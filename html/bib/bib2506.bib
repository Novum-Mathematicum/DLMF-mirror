      note = {An extended-precision C code for special functions.  The library uses arbitrary-precision
              ball arithmetic. Ball arithmetic is an efficient technique for performing numerical computations
              with automatic and rigorous tracking of error bounds. Arb is designed with computer algebra
              and computational number theory in mind, extending the principles behind FLINT to the
              domain of real and complex numbers.}}
