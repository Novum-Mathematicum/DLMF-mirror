Many special cases of $q$ -series arise in the theory of partitions, a topic treated in §§ 27.14(i) and [26.9](./26.9.md "§26.9 Integer Partitions: Restricted Number and Part Size ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 26 Combinatorial Analysis") . In Lie algebras Lepowsky and Milne ([1978](./bib/L.html#bib1415 "Lie algebraic approaches to classical partition identities")) and Lepowsky and Wilson ([1982](./bib/L.html#bib1416 "A Lie theoretic interpretation and proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities")) laid foundations for extensive interaction with $q$ -series. These and other applications are described in the surveys Andrews ([1974](./bib/index.html#bib91 "Applications of basic hypergeometric functions"), [1986](./bib/index.html#bib95 "q -Series: Their Development and Application in Analysis, Number Theory, Combinatorics, Physics, and Computer Algebra")). More recent applications are given in Gasper and Rahman ([2004](./bib/G.html#bib862 "Basic Hypergeometric Series"), Chapter 8) and Fine ([1988](./bib/F.html#bib801 "Basic Hypergeometric Series and Applications"), Chapters 1 and 2).
