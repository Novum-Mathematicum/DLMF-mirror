Annotations for Ch.13

From ( 13.14.2 ) and ( 13.14.3 ) $M_{\kappa,\mu}\left(z\right)$ has the same zeros as $M\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+\mu-\kappa,1+2\mu,z\right)$ and $W_{\kappa,\mu}\left(z\right)$ has the same zeros as $U\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+\mu-\kappa,1+2\mu,z\right)$ , hence the results given in § [13.9](./13.9.md "§13.9 Zeros ‣ Kummer Functions ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") can be adopted.

Asymptotic approximations to the zeros when the parameters $\kappa$ and/or $\mu$ are large can be found by reversion of the uniform approximations provided in §§ [13.20](./13.20.md "§13.20 Uniform Asymptotic Approximations for Large 𝜇 ‣ Whittaker Functions ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") and [13.21](./13.21.md "§13.21 Uniform Asymptotic Approximations for Large 𝜅 ‣ Whittaker Functions ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") . For example, if $\mu(\geq 0)$ is fixed and $\kappa(>0)$ is large, then the $r$ th positive zero $\phi_{r}$ of $M_{\kappa,\mu}\left(z\right)$ is given by

$$
\phi_{r}=\frac{j_{2\mu,r}^{2}}{4\kappa}+j_{2\mu,r}O\left(\kappa^{-\frac{3}{2}}\right), \tag{13.22.1}
$$

where $j_{2\mu,r}$ is the $r$ th positive zero of the Bessel function $J_{2\mu}\left(x\right)$ (§ 10.21(i) ). ( 13.22.1 ) is a weaker version of ( 13.9.8 ).
