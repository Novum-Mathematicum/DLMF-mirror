:::

Tables of zonal polynomials are given in James ([1964](./bib/J.html#bib1161 "Distributions of matrix variates and latent roots derived from normal samples")) for $|\kappa|\leq 6$ , Parkhurst and James ([1974](./bib/P.html#bib1849 "Zonal Polynomials of Order 1 Through 12")) for $|\kappa|\leq 12$ , and Muirhead ([1982](./bib/M.html#bib1667 "Aspects of Multivariate Statistical Theory"), p. 238) for $|\kappa|\leq 5$ . Each table expresses the zonal polynomials as linear combinations of monomial symmetric functions.
