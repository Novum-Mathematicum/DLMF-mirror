In multivariate statistical analysis based on the multivariate normal distribution, the probability density functions of many random matrices are expressible in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions of matrix argument ${{}_{p}F_{q}}$ , with $p\leq 2$ and $q\leq 1$ . See James ([1964](./bib/J.html#bib1161 "Distributions of matrix variates and latent roots derived from normal samples")), Muirhead ([1982](./bib/M.html#bib1667 "Aspects of Multivariate Statistical Theory")), Takemura ([1984](./bib/T.html#bib2200 "Zonal Polynomials")), Farrell ([1985](./bib/F.html#bib776 "Multivariate Calculation. Use of the Continuous Groups")), and Chikuse ([2003](./bib/C.html#bib492 "Statistics on Special Manifolds")) for extensive treatments.

For other statistical applications of ${{}_{p}F_{q}}$ functions of matrix argument see Perlman and Olkin ([1980](./bib/P.html#bib1866 "Unbiasedness of invariant tests for MANOVA and other multivariate problems")), Groeneboom and Truax ([2000](./bib/G.html#bib987 "A monotonicity property of the power function of multivariate tests")), Bhaumik and Sarkar ([2002](./bib/B.html#bib275 "On the power function of the likelihood ratio test for MANOVA")), Richards ([2004](./bib/R.html#bib1948 "Total positivity properties of generalized hypergeometric functions of matrix argument")) (monotonicity of power functions of multivariate statistical test criteria), Bingham et al. ([1992](./bib/B.html#bib285 "Approximating the matrix Fisher and Bingham distributions: Applications to spherical regression and Procrustes analysis")) (Procrustes analysis), and Phillips ([1986](./bib/P.html#bib1874 "The exact distribution of the Wald statistic")) (exact distributions of statistical test criteria). These references all use results related to the integral formulas ( 35.4.7 ) and ( 35.5.8 ).

For applications of the integral representation ( 35.5.3 ) see McFarland and Richards ([2001](./bib/M.html#bib1580 "Exact misclassification probabilities for plug-in normal quadratic discriminant functions. I. The equal-means case"), [2002](./bib/M.html#bib1581 "Exact misclassification probabilities for plug-in normal quadratic discriminant functions. II. The heterogeneous case")) (statistical estimation of misclassification probabilities for discriminating between multivariate normal populations). The asymptotic approximations of ยง 35.7(iv) are applied in numerous statistical contexts in Butler and Wood ([2002](./bib/B.html#bib393 "Laplace approximations for hypergeometric functions with matrix argument")).

In chemistry, Wei and Eichinger ([1993](./bib/W.html#bib2385 "Asymptotic expansions of some matrix argument hypergeometric functions, with applications to macromolecules")) expresses the probability density functions of macromolecules in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions of matrix argument, and develop asymptotic approximations for these density functions.

In the nascent area of applications of zonal polynomials to the limiting probability distributions of symmetric random matrices, one of the most comprehensive accounts is Rains ([1998](./bib/R.html#bib1920 "Normal limit theorems for symmetric random matrices")).
