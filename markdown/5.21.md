Annotations for Ch.5
:::

An effective way of computing $\Gamma\left(z\right)$ in the right half-plane is backward recurrence, beginning with a value generated from the asymptotic expansion ( 5.11.3 ). Or we can use forward recurrence, with an initial value obtained e.g. from ( 5.7.3 ). For the left half-plane we can continue the backward recurrence or make use of the reflection formula ( 5.5.3 ).

Similarly for $\ln\Gamma\left(z\right)$ , $\psi\left(z\right)$ , and the polygamma functions.

Another approach is to apply numerical quadrature (§ [3.5](./3.5.md "§3.5 Quadrature ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ) to the integral ( 5.9.2 ), using paths of steepest descent for the contour. See Schmelzer and Trefethen ([2007](./bib/S.html#bib2010 "Computing the gamma function using contour integrals and rational approximations")).
