Given $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$ , with $\Im\left(\omega_{3}/\omega_{1}\right)>0$ , the nome $q$ is computed from $q=e^{i\pi\omega_{3}/\omega_{1}}$ . For $\wp\left(z\right)$ we apply ( 23.6.2 ) and ( 23.6.5 ), generating all needed values of the theta functions by the methods described in § [20.14](./20.14.md "§20.14 Methods of Computation ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 20 Theta Functions") .

The functions $\zeta\left(z\right)$ and $\sigma\left(z\right)$ are computed in a similar manner: the former by replacing $u$ and $z$ in ( 23.6.13 ) by $z$ and $\pi z/(2\omega_{1})$ , respectively, and also referring to ( 23.6.8 ); the latter by applying ( 23.6.9 ).

The modular functions $\lambda\left(\tau\right)$ , $J\left(\tau\right)$ , and $\eta\left(\tau\right)$ are also obtainable in a similar manner from their definitions in § 23.15(ii) .

**Notes:**

For ( 23.22.1 ) combine ( 23.6.16 ), ( 23.6.17 ), ( 22.20.6 ), ( 23.3.5 )–( 23.3.7 ), and use analytical continuation. ( 23.22.2 ) and ( 23.22.3 ) follow from ( 23.5.3 ) and ( 23.5.7 ), respectively.

Suppose that the lattice $\mathbb{L}$ is given. Then a pair of generators $2\omega_{1}$ and $2\omega_{3}$ can be chosen in an almost canonical way as follows. For $2\omega_{1}$ choose a nonzero point of $\mathbb{L}$ of smallest absolute value. (There will be $2$ , $4$ , or $6$ possible choices.) For $2\omega_{3}$ choose a nonzero point that is not a multiple of $2\omega_{1}$ and is such that $\Im\tau>0$ and $|\tau|$ is as small as possible, where $\tau=\omega_{3}/\omega_{1}$ . (There will be either $1$ or $2$ possible choices.) This yields a pair of generators that satisfy $\Im\tau>0$ , $|\Re\tau|\leq\tfrac{1}{2}$ , $|\tau|>1$ . In consequence, $q=e^{i\pi\omega_{3}/\omega_{1}}$ satisfies $|q|\leq e^{-\pi\sqrt{3}/2}=0.0658\dots$ . The corresponding values of $e_{1}$ , $e_{2}$ , $e_{3}$ are calculated from ( 23.6.2 )–( 23.6.4 ), then $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ are obtained from ( 23.3.6 ) and ( 23.3.7 ).


### Starting from Invariants

**Clarification (effective with 1.1.2):**

The statement “If $c$ and $d$ are real” has been clarified to read “If $c$ and $d$ are real, and the discriminant is positive, that is $c^{3}-27d^{2}>0$ ”. The statement “If $c$ and $d$ are not both real” has been clarified to read If $c^{3}-27d^{2}<0$ , or $c$ and $d$ are not both real”. *Suggested 2021-04-05 by Alan Barnes*

Suppose that the invariants $g_{2}=c$ , $g_{3}=d$ , are given, for example in the differential equation ( 23.3.10 ) or via coefficients of an elliptic curve (§ 23.20(ii) ). The determination of suitable generators $2\omega_{1}$ and $2\omega_{3}$ is the classical *inversion problem* (Whittaker and Watson ([1927](./bib/W.html#bib2404 "A Course of Modern Analysis"), §21.73), McKean and Moll ([1999](./bib/M.html#bib1582 "Elliptic Curves"), §2.12); see also § 20.9(i) and McKean and Moll ([1999](./bib/M.html#bib1582 "Elliptic Curves"), §2.16)). This problem is solvable as follows:


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
2\omega_{1}M\left(1,k^{\prime}\right)=-2i\omega_{3}M\left(1,k\right)=\frac{\pi}{3}\sqrt{\frac{c(2+k^{2}{k^{\prime}}^{2})({k^{\prime}}^{2}-k^{2})}{d(1-k^{2}{k^{\prime}}^{2})}}, \tag{23.22.1}
$$


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
2\omega_{1}=-2i\omega_{3}=\frac{\left(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)^{2}}{2\sqrt{\pi}c^{1/4}}. \tag{23.22.2}
$$


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
2\omega_{1}=2e^{-\pi i/3}\omega_{3}=\frac{\left(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right)^{3}}{2\pi d^{1/6}}. \tag{23.22.3}
$$

Assume $c=g_{2}=-4(3-2i)$ and $d=g_{3}=4(4-2i)$ . Then $\alpha=-1-2i$ , $\beta=1$ , $\gamma=2i$ ; $k^{2}=\ifrac{(7+6i)}{17}$ , and ${k^{\prime}}^{2}=\ifrac{(10-6i)}{17}$ . Working to 6 decimal places we obtain

<a id="E4"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle 2\omega_{1} \displaystyle=0.867568+i1.466607, \tag{23.22.4}
$$

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle 2\omega_{3} \displaystyle=-1.223741+i1.328694,
$$

<a id="Ex3"></a>
