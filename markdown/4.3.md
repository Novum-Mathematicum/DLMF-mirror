**Change (effective with 1.0.11):**

The figure was rescaled, with symmetry lines added, to make evident the symmetry due to the inverse relationship between the two functions. *Suggested 2015-11-12 by James W. Pitman*

Figure 4.3.2 illustrates the conformal mapping of the strip $-\pi<\Im z<\pi$ onto the whole $w$ -plane cut along the negative real axis, where $w=e^{z}$ and $z=\ln w$ (principal value). Corresponding points share the same letters, with bars signifying complex conjugates. Lines parallel to the real axis in the $z$ -plane map onto rays in the $w$ -plane, and lines parallel to the imaginary axis in the $z$ -plane map onto circles centered at the origin in the $w$ -plane. In the labeling of corresponding points $r$ is a real parameter that can lie anywhere in the interval $(0,\infty)$ .
