Whereas multiplicative number theory is concerned with functions arising from prime factorization, additive number theory treats functions related to addition of integers. The basic problem is that of expressing a given positive integer $n$ as a sum of integers from some prescribed set $S$ whose members are primes, squares, cubes, or other special integers. Each representation of $n$ as a sum of elements of $S$ is called a *partition* of $n$ , and the number $S(n)$ of such partitions is often of great interest. The subsections that follow describe problems from additive number theory.

*Every even integer $n>4$ is the sum of two odd primes.* In this case, $S(n)$ is the number of solutions of the equation $n=p+q$ , where $p$ and $q$ are odd primes. Goldbach’s assertion is that $S(n)\geq 1$ for all even $n>4$ . This conjecture dates back to 1742 and was undecided in 2009, although it has been confirmed numerically up to very large numbers. Vinogradov ([1937](./bib/V.html#bib2335 "Representation of an odd number as a sum of three primes (Russian)")) proves that every sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three odd primes, and Chen ([1966](./bib/C.html#bib479 "On the representation of a large even integer as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes")) shows that every sufficiently large even integer is the sum of a prime and a number with no more than two prime factors.

The [current status](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldbach%27s_conjecture&oldid=60319325) of Goldbach’s conjecture is described in the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) .

This problem is named after Edward Waring who, in 1770, stated without proof and with limited numerical evidence, that every positive integer $n$ is the sum of four squares, of nine cubes, of nineteen fourth powers, and so on. Waring’s problem is to find, for each positive integer $k$ , whether there is an integer $m$ (depending only on $k$ ) such that the equation


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
n=x_{1}^{k}+x_{2}^{k}+\dots+x_{m}^{k} \tag{27.13.1}
$$

has nonnegative integer solutions for all $n\geq 1$ . The smallest $m$ that exists for a given $k$ is denoted by $g\left(k\right)$ . Similarly, $G\left(k\right)$ denotes the smallest $m$ for which ( 27.13.1 ) has nonnegative integer solutions for all sufficiently large $n$ .

Lagrange ([1770](./bib/L.html#bib1368 "Démonstration d’un Théoréme d’Arithmétique")) proves that $g\left(2\right)=4$ , and during the next 139 years the existence of $g\left(k\right)$ was shown for $k=3,4,5,6,7,8,10$ . Hilbert ([1909](./bib/H.html#bib1076 "Beweis für die Darstellbarkeit der ganzen Zahlen durch eine feste Anzahl n ter Potenzen (Waringsches Problem)")) proves the existence of $g\left(k\right)$ for every $k$ but does not determine its corresponding numerical value. The exact value of $g\left(k\right)$ is now known for every $k\leq 200,000$ . For example, $g\left(3\right)=9$ , $g\left(4\right)=19$ , $g\left(5\right)=37$ , $g\left(6\right)=73$ , $g\left(7\right)=143$ , and $g\left(8\right)=279$ . A general formula states that


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
g\left(k\right)\geq 2^{k}+\left\lfloor\frac{3^{k}}{2^{k}}\right\rfloor-2, \tag{27.13.2}
$$

for all $k\geq 2$ , with equality if $4\leq k\leq 200,000$ . If $3^{k}=q2^{k}+r$ with $0<r<2^{k}$ , then equality holds in ( 27.13.2 ) provided $r+q\leq 2^{k}$ , a condition that is satisfied with at most a finite number of exceptions.

The existence of $G\left(k\right)$ follows from that of $g\left(k\right)$ because $G\left(k\right)\leq g\left(k\right)$ , but only the values $G\left(2\right)=4$ and $G\left(4\right)=16$ are known exactly. Some upper bounds smaller than $g\left(k\right)$ are known. For example, $G\left(3\right)\leq 7$ , $G\left(5\right)\leq 23$ , $G\left(6\right)\leq 36$ , $G\left(7\right)\leq 53$ , and $G\left(8\right)\leq 73$ . Hardy and Littlewood ([1925](./bib/H.html#bib1044 "Some problems of “Partitio Numerorum” (VI): Further researches in Waring’s Problem")) conjectures that $G\left(k\right)<2k+1$ when $k$ is not a power of 2, and that $G\left(k\right)\leq 4k$ when $k$ is a power of 2, but the most that is known (in 2009) is $G\left(k\right)<ck\ln k$ for some constant $c$ . A survey is given in Ellison ([1971](./bib/E.html#bib741 "Waring’s problem")).

For a given integer $k\geq 2$ the function $r_{k}\left(n\right)$ is defined as the number of solutions of the equation


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
n=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+x_{k}^{2}, \tag{27.13.3}
$$

where the $x_{j}$ are integers, positive, negative, or zero, and the order of the summands is taken into account.

Jacobi ([1829](./bib/J.html#bib1153 "Fundamenta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ellipticarum")) notes that $r_{2}\left(n\right)$ is the coefficient of $x^{n}$ in the square of the theta function $\vartheta\left(x\right)$ :


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
\vartheta\left(x\right)=1+2\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}x^{m^{2}}, \tag{27.13.4}
$$

(In § 20.2(i) , $\vartheta\left(x\right)$ is denoted by $\theta_{3}\left(0,x\right)$ .) Thus,


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
(\vartheta\left(x\right))^{2}=1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}r_{2}\left(n\right)x^{n}. \tag{27.13.5}
$$

One of Jacobi’s identities implies that


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
(\vartheta\left(x\right))^{2}=1+4\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\delta_{1}(n)-\delta_{3}(n)\right)x^{n}, \tag{27.13.6}
$$

where $\delta_{1}(n)$ and $\delta_{3}(n)$ are the number of divisors of $n$ congruent respectively to 1 and 3 (mod 4), and by equating coefficients in ( 27.13.5 ) and ( 27.13.6 ) Jacobi deduced that


<a id="E7"></a>
$$
r_{2}\left(n\right)=4\left(\delta_{1}(n)-\delta_{3}(n)\right). \tag{27.13.7}
$$

Hence $r_{2}\left(5\right)=8$ because both divisors, $1$ and $5$ , are congruent to $1\pmod{4}$ . In fact, there are four representations, given by $5=2^{2}+1^{2}=2^{2}+(-1)^{2}=(-2)^{2}+1^{2}=(-2)^{2}+(-1)^{2}$ , and four more with the order of summands reversed.

By similar methods Jacobi proved that $r_{4}\left(n\right)=8\sigma_{1}\left(n\right)$ if $n$ is odd, whereas, if $n$ is even, $r_{4}\left(n\right)=24$ times the sum of the odd divisors of $n$ . Mordell ([1917](./bib/M.html#bib1653 "On the representation of numbers as a sum of ⁢ 2 r squares")) notes that $r_{k}\left(n\right)$ is the coefficient of $x^{n}$ in the power-series expansion of the $k$ th power of the series for $\vartheta\left(x\right)$ . Explicit formulas for $r_{k}\left(n\right)$ have been obtained by similar methods for $k=6,8,10$ , and $12$ , but they are more complicated. Exact formulas for $r_{k}\left(n\right)$ have also been found for $k=3,5$ , and $7$ , and for all even $k\leq 24$ . For values of $k>24$ the analysis of $r_{k}\left(n\right)$ is considerably more complicated (see Hardy ([1940](./bib/H.html#bib1040 "Ramanujan. Twelve Lectures on Subjects Suggested by His Life and Work"))). Also, Milne ([1996](./bib/M.html#bib1633 "New infinite families of exact sums of squares formulas, Jacobi elliptic functions, and Ramanujan’s tau function"), [2002](./bib/M.html#bib1635 "Infinite families of exact sums of squares formulas, Jacobi elliptic functions, continued fractions, and Schur functions")) announce new infinite families of explicit formulas extending Jacobi’s identities. For more than 8 squares, Milne’s identities are not the same as those obtained earlier by Mordell and others.
