Annotations for §1.10 and Ch.1
:::

Let $f(z)$ be analytic on the disk $\left|z-z_{0}\right|<R$ . Then


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
f(z)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{f^{(n)}(z_{0})}{n!}(z-z_{0})^{n}. \tag{1.10.1}
$$

The right-hand side is the *Taylor series for* $f(z)$ *at* $z=z_{0}$ , and its radius of convergence is at least $R$ .

Annotations for §1.10 and Ch.1
:::

Let $f_{1}(z)$ be analytic in a domain $D_{1}$ . If $f_{2}(z)$ , analytic in $D_{2}$ , equals $f_{1}(z)$ on an arc in $D=D_{1}\cap D_{2}$ , or on just an infinite number of points with a limit point in $D$ , then they are equal throughout $D$ and $f_{2}(z)$ is called an *analytic continuation* of $f_{1}(z)$ . We write $(f_{1},D_{1})$ , $(f_{2},D_{2})$ to signify this continuation.

Suppose $z(t)=x(t)+\mathrm{i}y(t)$ , $a\leq t\leq b$ , is an arc and $a=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n}=b$ . Suppose the subarc $z(t)$ , $t\in[t_{j-1},t_{j}]$ is contained in a domain $D_{j}$ , $j=1,\dots,n$ . The function $f_{1}(z)$ on $D_{1}$ is said to be *analytically continued along the path* $z(t)$ , $a\leq t\leq b$ , if there is a chain $(f_{1},D_{1})$ , $(f_{2},D_{2}),\dots,(f_{n},D_{n})$ .

Analytic continuation is a powerful aid in establishing transformations or functional equations for complex variables, because it enables the problem to be reduced to: (a) deriving the transformation (or functional equation) with real variables; followed by (b) finding the domain on which the transformed function is analytic.

Suppose $f(z)$ is analytic in the *annulus* $r_{1}<\left|z-z_{0}\right|<r_{2}$ , $0\leq r_{1}<r_{2}\leq\infty$ , and $r\in(r_{1},r_{2})$ . Then


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
f(z)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty}a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n}, \tag{1.10.6}
$$

where


<a id="E7"></a>
$$
a_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{i}}\int_{\left|z-z_{0}\right|=r}\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_{0})^{n+1}}\,\mathrm{d}z, \tag{1.10.7}
$$

and the integration contour is described once in the positive sense. The series ( 1.10.6 ) converges uniformly and absolutely on compact sets in the annulus.

Let $r_{1}=0$ , so that the annulus becomes the *punctured neighborhood* $N$ : $0<\left|z-z_{0}\right|<r_{2}$ , and assume that $f(z)$ is analytic in $N$ , but not at $z_{0}$ . Then $z=z_{0}$ is an *isolated singularity* of $f(z)$ . This singularity is *removable* if $a_{n}=0$ for all $n<0$ , and in this case the Laurent series becomes the Taylor series. Next, $z_{0}$ is a *pole* if $a_{n}\not=0$ for at least one, but only finitely many, negative $n$ . If $-n$ is the first negative integer (counting from $-\infty$ ) with $a_{-n}\not=0$ , then $z_{0}$ is a *pole of order* (or *multiplicity* ) $n$ . Lastly, if $a_{n}\not=0$ for infinitely many negative $n$ , then $z_{0}$ is an *isolated essential singularity* .

The singularities of $f(z)$ at infinity are classified in the same way as the singularities of $f(1/z)$ at $z=0$ .

An isolated singularity $z_{0}$ is always removable when $\lim_{z\to z_{0}}f(z)$ exists, for example $(\sin z)/z$ at $z=0$ .

The coefficient $a_{-1}$ of $(z-z_{0})^{-1}$ in the Laurent series for $f(z)$ is called the *residue* of $f(z)$ at $z_{0}$ , and denoted by $\Residue_{z=z_{0}}[f(z)]$ , $\Residue\limits_{z=z_{0}}[f(z)]$ , or (when there is no ambiguity) $\Residue[f(z)]$ .

A function whose only singularities, other than the point at infinity, are poles is called a *meromorphic function* . If the poles are infinite in number, then the point at infinity is called an *essential singularity* : it is the limit point of the poles.

Functions which have more than one value at a given point $z$ are called *multivalued* (or *many-valued* ) functions. Let $F(z)$ be a multivalued function and $D$ be a domain. If we can assign a unique value $f(z)$ to $F(z)$ at each point of $D$ , and $f(z)$ is analytic on $D$ , then $f(z)$ is a *branch* of $F(z)$ .

$F(z)=\sqrt{z}$ is two-valued for $z\not=0$ . If $D=\mathbb{C}\setminus(-\infty,0]$ and $z=r{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{i}\theta}$ , then one branch is $\sqrt{r}{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{i}\theta/2}$ , the other branch is $-\sqrt{r}{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{i}\theta/2}$ , with $-\pi<\theta<\pi$ in both cases. Similarly if $D=\mathbb{C}\setminus[0,\infty)$ , then one branch is $\sqrt{r}{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{i}\theta/2}$ , the other branch is $-\sqrt{r}{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{i}\theta/2}$ , with $0<\theta<2\pi$ in both cases.

A *cut domain* is one from which the points on finitely many nonintersecting simple contours (§ 1.9(iii) ) have been removed. Each contour is called a *cut* . A *cut neighborhood* is formed by deleting a ray emanating from the center. (Or more generally, a simple contour that starts at the center and terminates on the boundary.)

Suppose $F(z)$ is multivalued and $a$ is a point such that there exists a branch of $F(z)$ in a cut neighborhood of $a$ , but there does not exist a branch of $F(z)$ in any punctured neighborhood of $a$ . Then $a$ is a *branch point* of $F(z)$ . For example, $z=0$ is a branch point of $\sqrt{z}$ .

Branches can be constructed in two ways:

(a) By introducing appropriate cuts from the branch points and restricting $F(z)$ to be single-valued in the cut plane (or domain).

(b) By specifying the value of $F(z)$ at a point $z_{0}$ (not a branch point), and requiring $F(z)$ to be continuous on any path that begins at $z_{0}$ and does not pass through any branch points or other singularities of $F(z)$ .

If the path circles a branch point at $z=a$ , $k$ times in the positive sense, and returns to $z_{0}$ without encircling any other branch point, then its value is denoted conventionally as $F((z_{0}-a){\mathrm{e}}^{2k\pi\mathrm{i}}+a)$ .

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be real or complex numbers that are not integers. The function $F(z)=(1-z)^{\alpha}(1+z)^{\beta}$ is many-valued with branch points at $\pm 1$ . Branches of $F(z)$ can be defined, for example, in the cut plane $D$ obtained from $\mathbb{C}$ by removing the real axis from $1$ to $\infty$ and from $-1$ to $-\infty$ ; see Figure 1.10.1 . One such branch is obtained by assigning $(1-z)^{\alpha}$ and $(1+z)^{\beta}$ their principal values (§ 4.2(iv) ).

Alternatively, take $z_{0}$ to be any point in $D$ and set $F(z_{0})={\mathrm{e}}^{\alpha\ln\left(1-z_{0}\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta\ln\left(1+z_{0}\right)}$ where the logarithms assume their principal values. (Thus if $z_{0}$ is in the interval $(-1,1)$ , then the logarithms are real.) Then the value of $F(z)$ at any other point is obtained by analytic continuation.

Thus if $F(z)$ is continued along a path that circles $z=1$ $m$ times in the positive sense and returns to $z_{0}$ without circling $z=-1$ , then $F((z_{0}-1){\mathrm{e}}^{2m\pi\mathrm{i}}+1)={\mathrm{e}}^{\alpha\ln\left(1-z_{0}\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta\ln\left(1+z_{0}\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{2\pi\mathrm{i}m\alpha}$ . If the path also circles $z=-1$ $n$ times in the clockwise or negative sense before returning to $z_{0}$ , then the value of $F(z_{0})$ becomes ${\mathrm{e}}^{\alpha\ln\left(1-z_{0}\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{\beta\ln\left(1+z_{0}\right)}{\mathrm{e}}^{2\pi\mathrm{i}m\alpha}{\mathrm{e}}^{-2\pi\mathrm{i}n\beta}$ .

Suppose that

$$
f(z)=f(z_{0})+\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}f_{n}(z-z_{0})^{\mu+n}, \tag{1.10.15}
$$

where $\mu>0$ , $f_{0}\not=0$ , and the series converges in a neighborhood of $z_{0}$ . (For example, when $\mu$ is an integer $f(z)-f(z_{0})$ has a zero of order $\mu$ at $z_{0}$ .) Let $w_{0}=f(z_{0})$ . Then ( 1.10.12 ) has a solution $z=F(w)$ , where


<a id="E16"></a>
$$
F(w)=z_{0}+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}F_{n}(w-w_{0})^{n/\mu} \tag{1.10.16}

in a neighborhood of $w_{0}$ , $nF_{n}$ being the residue of $1/(f(z)-f(z_{0}))^{n/\mu}$ at $z=z_{0}$ .

It should be noted that different branches of $(w-w_{0})^{1/\mu}$ used in forming $(w-w_{0})^{n/\mu}$ in ( 1.10.16 ) give rise to different solutions of ( 1.10.12 ). Also, if in addition $g(z)$ is analytic at $z_{0}$ , then

g(F(w))=g(z_{0})+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}G_{n}(w-w_{0})^{n/\mu}, \tag{1.10.17}

Annotations for §1.10 and Ch.1
:::

Let $D$ be a domain and $[a,b]$ be a closed finite segment of the real axis. Assume that for each $t\in[a,b]$ , $f(z,t)$ is an analytic function of $z$ in $D$ , and also that $f(z,t)$ is a continuous function of both variables. Then


<a id="E18"></a>
$$
F(z)=\int^{b}_{a}f(z,t)\,\mathrm{d}t \tag{1.10.18}
$$

is analytic in $D$ and its derivatives of all orders can be found by differentiating under the sign of integration.

This result is also true when $b=\infty$ , or when $f(z,t)$ has a singularity at $t=b$ , with the following conditions. For each $t\in[a,b)$ , $f(z,t)$ is analytic in $D$ ; $f(z,t)$ is a continuous function of both variables when $z\in D$ and $t\in[a,b)$ ; the integral ( 1.10.18 ) converges at $b$ , and this convergence is uniform with respect to $z$ in every compact subset $S$ of $D$ .

The last condition means that given $\epsilon$ ( $>0$ ) there exists a number $a_{0}\in[a,b)$ that is independent of $z$ and is such that


<a id="E19"></a>
$$
\left|\int_{a_{1}}^{b}f(z,t)\,\mathrm{d}t\right|<\epsilon, \tag{1.10.19}
$$

for all $a_{1}\in[a_{0},b)$ and all $z\in S$ ; compare § 1.5(iv) .

If $\left|f(z,t)\right|\leq M(t)$ for $z\in S$ and $\int^{b}_{a}M(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$ converges, then the integral ( 1.10.18 ) converges uniformly and absolutely in $S$ .

Annotations for §1.10 and Ch.1
:::

Let $p_{k,m}=\prod_{n=k}^{m}(1+a_{n})$ . If for some $k\geq 1$ , $p_{k,m}\to p_{k}\not=0$ as $m\to\infty$ , then we say that the infinite product $\prod^{\infty}_{n=1}(1+a_{n})$ *converges* . (The integer $k$ may be greater than one to allow for a finite number of zero factors.) The convergence of the product is *absolute* if $\prod^{\infty}_{n=1}(1+\left|a_{n}\right|)$ converges. The product $\prod^{\infty}_{n=1}(1+a_{n})$ , with $a_{n}\not=-1$ for all $n$ , converges iff $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ln\left(1+a_{n}\right)$ converges; and it converges absolutely iff $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\left|a_{n}\right|$ converges.

Suppose $a_{n}=a_{n}(z)$ , $z\in D$ , a domain. The convergence of the infinite product is *uniform* if the sequence of partial products converges uniformly.

Suppose that $a_{n}(z)$ are analytic functions in $D$ . If there is an $N$ , independent of $z\in D$ , such that


<a id="E20"></a>
$$
\left|\ln\left(1+a_{n}(z)\right)\right|\leq M_{n}, \tag{1.10.20}

and


<a id="E21"></a>
$$
\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}M_{n}<\infty, \tag{1.10.21}
$$

then the product $\prod^{\infty}_{n=1}(1+a_{n}(z))$ converges uniformly to an analytic function $p(z)$ in $D$ , and $p(z)=0$ only when at least one of the factors $1+a_{n}(z)$ is zero in $D$ . This conclusion remains true if, in place of ( 1.10.20 ), $\left|a_{n}(z)\right|\leq M_{n}$ for all $n$ , and again $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}M_{n}<\infty$ .

Let $F(x,z)$ have a converging power series expansion of the form


<a id="E26"></a>
$$
F(x;z)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}p_{n}(x)z^{n}, \tag{1.10.26}
$$

The radius of convergence $R$ might depend on $x$ . Then $F(x;z)$ is the *generating function* for the functions $p_{n}(x)$ , which will automatically have an integral representation


<a id="E27"></a>
$$
p_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{i}}\int_{\left|z\right|=r}\frac{F(x;z)}{z^{n+1}}\,\mathrm{d}z, \tag{1.10.27}
$$

compare ( 1.10.7 ). Often Darboux’s method can be used to study the behavior of $p_{n}(x)$ as $n\to\infty$ . Compare § 2.10(iv) .


### Example

Annotations for §1.10(xi) , §1.10 and Ch.1
:::

Ultraspherical polynomials have generating function


<a id="E28"></a>
$$
F(x,\lambda;z)=\left(1-2xz+z^{2}\right)^{-\lambda}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}C^{(\lambda)}_{n}\left(x\right)z^{n}, \tag{1.10.28}
$$

Many properties are a direct consequence of this representation: Taking the $x$ -derivative gives us


<a id="E29"></a>
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}C^{(\lambda)}_{n}\left(x\right)z^{n}=2\lambda z\left(1-2xz+z^{2}\right)^{-\lambda-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2\lambda C^{(\lambda+1)}_{n}\left(x\right)z^{n+1}, \tag{1.10.29}
$$

and hence $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}C^{(\lambda)}_{n}\left(x\right)=2\lambda C^{(\lambda+1)}_{n-1}\left(x\right)$ , that is ( 18.9.19 ). The recurrence relation for $C^{(\lambda)}_{n}\left(x\right)$ in § 18.9(i) follows from $(1-2xz+z^{2})\frac{\partial}{\partial z}F(x,\lambda;z)=2\lambda(x-z)F(x,\lambda;z)$ , and the contour integral representation for $C^{(\lambda)}_{n}\left(x\right)$ in § 18.10(iii) is just ( 1.10.27 ).
