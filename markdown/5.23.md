Cody and Hillstrom ([1967](./bib/C.html#bib548 "Chebyshev approximations for the natural logarithm of the gamma function")) gives minimax rational approximations for $\ln\Gamma\left(x\right)$ for the ranges $0.5\leq x\leq 1.5$ , $1.5\leq x\leq 4$ , $4\leq x\leq 12$ ; precision is variable. Hart et al. ([1968](./bib/H.html#bib1051 "Computer Approximations")) gives minimax polynomial and rational approximations to $\Gamma\left(x\right)$ and $\ln\Gamma\left(x\right)$ in the intervals $0\leq x\leq 1$ , $8\leq x\leq 1000$ , $12\leq x\leq 1000$ ; precision is variable. Cody et al. ([1973](./bib/C.html#bib552 "Chebyshev approximations for the psi function")) gives minimax rational approximations for $\psi\left(x\right)$ for the ranges $0.5\leq x\leq 3$ and $3\leq x<\infty$ ; precision is variable.

For additional approximations see Hart et al. ([1968](./bib/H.html#bib1051 "Computer Approximations"), Appendix B), Luke ([1975](./bib/L.html#bib1501 "Mathematical Functions and their Approximations"), pp. 22–23), and Weniger ([2003](./bib/W.html#bib2394 "A rational approximant for the digamma function")).

Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2")) gives the coefficients to 20D for the Chebyshev-series expansions of $\Gamma\left(1+x\right)$ , $1/\Gamma\left(1+x\right)$ , $\Gamma\left(x+3\right)$ , $\ln\Gamma\left(x+3\right)$ , $\psi\left(x+3\right)$ , and the first six derivatives of $\psi\left(x+3\right)$ for $0\leq x\leq 1$ . These coefficients are reproduced in Luke ([1975](./bib/L.html#bib1501 "Mathematical Functions and their Approximations")). Clenshaw ([1962](./bib/C.html#bib525 "Chebyshev Series for Mathematical Functions")) also gives 20D Chebyshev-series coefficients for $\Gamma\left(1+x\right)$ and its reciprocal for $0\leq x\leq 1$ . See Luke ([1975](./bib/L.html#bib1501 "Mathematical Functions and their Approximations"), pp. 22–23) for additional expansions.
