See § [1.12](./1.12.md "§1.12 Continued Fractions ‣ Topics of Discussion ‣ Chapter 1 Algebraic and Analytic Methods") for relevant properties of continued fractions, including the following definitions:


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
C=b_{0}+\cfrac{a_{1}}{b_{1}+\cfrac{a_{2}}{b_{2}+\cdots}}, \tag{3.10.1}
$$


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
C_{n}=b_{0}+\cfrac{a_{1}}{b_{1}+\cfrac{a_{2}}{b_{2}+\cdots}}\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=\frac{A_{n}}{B_{n}}. \tag{3.10.2}
$$

$C_{n}$ is the $n$ th *approximant* or *convergent* to $C$ .

Every convergent, asymptotic, or formal series


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
u_{0}+u_{1}+u_{2}+\cdots \tag{3.10.3}
$$

can be converted into a continued fraction $C$ of type ( 3.10.1 ), and with the property that the $n$ th convergent $C_{n}=A_{n}/B_{n}$ to $C$ is equal to the $n$ th partial sum of the series in ( 3.10.3 ), that is,


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
\frac{A_{n}}{B_{n}}=u_{0}+u_{1}+\dots+u_{n}, \tag{3.10.4}
$$

For instance, if none of the $u_{n}$ vanish, then we can define

<a id="E5"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle b_{0} \displaystyle=u_{0}, \tag{3.10.5}
$$

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle b_{1} \displaystyle=1,
$$

<a id="Ex3"></a>
$$
\displaystyle a_{1} \displaystyle=u_{1},
$$

<a id="Ex4"></a>
$$
\displaystyle b_{n} \displaystyle=1+\frac{u_{n}}{u_{n-1}},
$$

<a id="Ex5"></a>
$$
\displaystyle a_{n} \displaystyle=-\frac{u_{n}}{u_{n-1}}
$$

However, other continued fractions with the same limit may converge in a much larger domain of the complex plane than the fraction given by ( 3.10.4 ) and ( 3.10.5 ). For example, by converting the Maclaurin expansion of $\operatorname{arctan}z$ ( 4.24.3 ), we obtain a continued fraction with the same region of convergence ( $\left|z\right|\leq 1$ , $z\neq\pm\mathrm{i}$ ), whereas the continued fraction ( 4.25.4 ) converges for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ except on the branch cuts from $i$ to $i\infty$ and $-i$ to $-i\infty$ .

The quotient-difference algorithm is frequently unstable and may require high-precision arithmetic or exact arithmetic. A more stable version of the algorithm is discussed in Stokes ([1980](./bib/S.html#bib2173 "A stable quotient-difference algorithm")). For applications to Bessel functions and Whittaker functions (Chapters [10](./10.md "Chapter 10 Bessel Functions") and [13](./13.md "Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") ), see Gargantini and Henrici ([1967](./bib/G.html#bib857 "A continued fraction algorithm for the computation of higher transcendental functions in the complex plane")).

$$

is called a *Jacobi fraction ($J$-fraction)* . We say that it is *associated* with the formal power series $f(z)$ in ( 3.10.7 ) if the expansion of its $n$ th convergent $C_{n}$ in ascending powers of $z$ , agrees with ( 3.10.7 ) up to and including the term in $z^{2n-1}$ , $n=1,2,3,\dots$ . For the same function $f(z)$ , the convergent $C_{n}$ of the Jacobi fraction ( 3.10.11 ) equals the convergent $C_{2n}$ of the Stieltjes fraction ( 3.10.6 ).

### Forward Recurrence Algorithm

The $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ of ( 3.10.2 ) can be computed by means of three-term recurrence relations ( 1.12.5 ). However, this may be unstable; also overflow and underflow may occur when evaluating $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ (making it necessary to re-scale from time to time).

Then $u_{0}=C_{n}$ . To achieve a prescribed accuracy, either *a priori* knowledge is needed of the value of $n$ , or $n$ is determined by trial and error. In general this algorithm is more stable than the forward algorithm; see Jones and Thron ([1974](./bib/J.html#bib1181 "Numerical stability in evaluating continued fractions")).

The $n$ th partial sum $t_{0}+t_{1}+\dots+t_{n-1}$ equals the $n$ th convergent of ( 3.10.13 ), $n=1,2,3,\dots$ . In contrast to the preceding algorithms in this subsection no scaling problems arise and no *a priori* information is needed.

In Gautschi ([1979c](./bib/G.html#bib887 "Un procedimento di calcolo per le funzioni gamma incomplete")) the forward series algorithm is used for the evaluation of a continued fraction of an incomplete gamma function (see § [8.9](./8.9.md "§8.9 Continued Fractions ‣ Incomplete Gamma Functions ‣ Chapter 8 Incomplete Gamma and Related Functions") ).
