The hypergeometric function $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ is defined by the *Gauss series*


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
F\left(a,b;c;z\right)=\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{{\left(a\right)_{s}}{\left(b\right)_{s}}}{{\left(c\right)_{s}}s!}z^{s}=1+\frac{ab}{c}z+\frac{a(a+1)b(b+1)}{c(c+1)2!}z^{2}+\cdots=\frac{\Gamma\left(c\right)}{\Gamma\left(a\right)\Gamma\left(b\right)}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Gamma\left(a+s\right)\Gamma\left(b+s\right)}{\Gamma\left(c+s\right)s!}z^{s}, \tag{15.2.1}
$$

on the disk $|z|<1$ , and by analytic continuation elsewhere. In general, $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ does not exist when $c=0,-1,-2,\dots$ . The branch obtained by introducing a cut from $1$ to $+\infty$ on the real $z$ -axis, that is, the branch in the sector $|\operatorname{ph}\left(1-z\right)|\leq\pi$ , is the *principal branch* (or *principal value* ) of $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ .

For all values of $c$


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)=\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{{\left(a\right)_{s}}{\left(b\right)_{s}}}{\Gamma\left(c+s\right)s!}z^{s}, \tag{15.2.2}
$$

again with analytic continuation for other values of $z$ , and with the principal branch defined in a similar way.

*Except where indicated otherwise* principal branches of $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ and $\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ are assumed throughout the DLMF.

The difference between the principal branches on the two sides of the branch cut (§ 4.2(i) ) is given by


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
\mathbf{F}\left({a,b\atop c};x+\mathrm{i}0\right)-\mathbf{F}\left({a,b\atop c};x-\mathrm{i}0\right)=\frac{2\pi\mathrm{i}}{\Gamma\left(a\right)\Gamma\left(b\right)}(x-1)^{c-a-b}\mathbf{F}\left({c-a,c-b\atop c-a-b+1};1-x\right), \tag{15.2.3}
$$

On the circle of convergence, $|z|=1$ , the Gauss series:

* Converges absolutely when $\Re\left(c-a-b\right)>0$ .
* Converges conditionally when $-1<\Re\left(c-a-b\right)\leq 0$ and $z=1$ is excluded.
* Diverges when $\Re\left(c-a-b\right)\leq-1$ .

For the case $z=1$ see also § 15.4(ii) .

Annotations for §15.2 and Ch.15
:::

The principal branch of $\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ is an entire function of $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . The same is true of other branches, provided that $z=0$ , $1$ , and $\infty$ are excluded. As a multivalued function of $z$ , $\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ is analytic everywhere except for possible branch points at $z=0$ , $1$ , and $\infty$ . The same properties hold for $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ , except that as a function of $c$ , $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ in general has poles at $c=0,-1,-2,\dots$ .

Because of the analytic properties with respect to $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ , it is usually legitimate to take limits in formulas involving functions that are undefined for certain values of the parameters. In particular


<a id="E3_5"></a>
$$
\lim_{c\to-n}\frac{F\left(a,b;c;z\right)}{\Gamma\left(c\right)}=\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;-n;z\right)=\frac{{\left(a\right)_{n+1}}{\left(b\right)_{n+1}}}{(n+1)!}z^{n+1}F\left(a+n+1,b+n+1;n+2;z\right), \tag{15.2.3_5}
$$

For example, when $a=-m$ , $m=0,1,2,\dots$ , and $c\neq 0,-1,-2,\dots$ , $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ is a polynomial:


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
F\left(-m,b;c;z\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{m}\frac{{\left(-m\right)_{n}}{\left(b\right)_{n}}}{{\left(c\right)_{n}}{n!}}z^{n}=\sum_{n=0}^{m}(-1)^{n}\genfrac{(}{)}{0.0pt}{}{m}{n}\frac{{\left(b\right)_{n}}}{{\left(c\right)_{n}}}z^{n}. \tag{15.2.4}
$$

This formula is also valid when $c=-m-\ell$ , $\ell=0,1,2,\dots$ , provided that we use the interpretation


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
F\left({-m,b\atop-m-\ell};z\right)=\lim_{c\to-m-\ell}\left(\lim_{a\to-m}F\left({a,b\atop c};z\right)\right), \tag{15.2.5}
$$

and not


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
F\left({-m,b\atop-m-\ell};z\right)=\lim_{a\to-m}F\left({a,b\atop a-\ell};z\right), \tag{15.2.6}
$$

which sometimes needs to be used in § [15.4](./15.4.md "§15.4 Special Cases ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 15 Hypergeometric Function") . (Both interpretations give solutions of the hypergeometric differential equation ( 15.10.1 ), as does $\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ , which is analytic at $c=0,-1,-2,\dots$ .)

For comparison of $F\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ and $\mathbf{F}\left(a,b;c;z\right)$ , with the former using the limit interpretation ( 15.2.5 ), see Figures 15.3.6 and 15.3.7 .

Let $m$ be a nonnegative integer. Formula ( 15.4.6 ) reads $F\left(a,b;a;z\right)=(1-z)^{-b}$ . The right-hand side can be seen as an analytical continuation for the left-hand side when $a$ approaches $-m$ . In that case we are using interpretation ( 15.2.6 ) since with interpretation ( 15.2.5 ) we would obtain that $F\left(-m,b;-m;z\right)$ is equal to the first $m+1$ terms of the Maclaurin series for $(1-z)^{-b}$ .
