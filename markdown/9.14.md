Incomplete Airy functions are defined by the contour integral ( 9.5.4 ) when one of the integration limits is replaced by a variable real or complex parameter. For information, including asymptotic approximations, computation, and applications, see Levey and Felsen ([1969](./bib/L.html#bib1423 "On incomplete Airy functions and their application to diffraction problems")), Constantinides and Marhefka ([1993](./bib/C.html#bib574 "Efficient and accurate computation of the incomplete Airy functions")), and Michaeli ([1996](./bib/M.html#bib1605 "Asymptotic analysis of edge-excited currents on a convex face of a perfectly conducting wedge under overlapping penumbra region conditions")).
