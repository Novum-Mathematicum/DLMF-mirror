Annotations for Ch.29
:::

Hargrave and Sleeman ([1977](./bib/H.html#bib1049 "Lamé polynomials of large order")) give asymptotic approximations for Lamé polynomials and their eigenvalues, including error bounds. The approximations for Lamé polynomials hold uniformly on the rectangle $0\leq\Re z\leq K$ , $0\leq\Im z\leq{K^{\prime}}$ , when $nk$ and $nk^{\prime}$ assume large real values. The approximating functions are exponential, trigonometric, and parabolic cylinder functions.
