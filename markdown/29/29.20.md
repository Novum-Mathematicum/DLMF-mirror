The eigenvalues $a^{m}_{\nu}\left(k^{2}\right)$ , $b^{m}_{\nu}\left(k^{2}\right)$ , and the Lamé functions $\mathit{Ec}^{m}_{\nu}\left(z,k^{2}\right)$ , $\mathit{Es}^{m}_{\nu}\left(z,k^{2}\right)$ , can be calculated by direct numerical methods applied to the differential equation ( 29.2.1 ); see § [3.7](./3.7.md "§3.7 Ordinary Differential Equations ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") . The normalization of Lamé functions given in § 29.3(v) can be carried out by quadrature (§ [3.5](./3.5.md "§3.5 Quadrature ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ).

A second approach is to solve the continued-fraction equations typified by ( 29.3.10 ) by Newton’s rule or other iterative methods; see § [3.8](./3.8.md "§3.8 Nonlinear Equations ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") . Initial approximations to the eigenvalues can be found, for example, from the asymptotic expansions supplied in § 29.7(i) . Subsequently, formulas typified by ( 29.6.4 ) can be applied to compute the coefficients of the Fourier expansions of the corresponding Lamé functions by backward recursion followed by application of formulas typified by ( 29.6.5 ) and ( 29.6.6 ) to achieve normalization; compare § [3.6](./3.6.md "§3.6 Linear Difference Equations ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") . (Equation ( 29.6.3 ) serves as a check.) The Fourier series may be summed using Clenshaw’s algorithm; see § 3.11(ii) . For further information see Jansen ([1977](./bib/J.html#bib1162 "Simple-periodic and Non-periodic Lamé Functions")).

A third method is to approximate eigenvalues and Fourier coefficients of Lamé functions by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite matrices using the methods of §§ 3.2(vi) and 3.8(iv) . These matrices are the same as those provided in § 29.15(i) for the computation of Lamé polynomials with the difference that $n$ has to be chosen sufficiently large. The approximations converge geometrically (§ 3.8(i) ) to the eigenvalues and coefficients of Lamé functions as $n\to\infty$ . The numerical computations described in Jansen ([1977](./bib/J.html#bib1162 "Simple-periodic and Non-periodic Lamé Functions")) are based in part upon this method.

A fourth method is by asymptotic approximations by zeros of orthogonal polynomials of increasing degree. See (f) of § 28.34(ii) .

The eigenvalues corresponding to Lamé polynomials are computed from eigenvalues of the finite tridiagonal matrices $\mathbf{M}$ given in § 29.15(i) , using methods described in § 3.2(vi) and Ritter ([1998](./bib/R.html#bib1956 "On the computation of Lamé functions, of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of some potential operators")). The corresponding eigenvectors yield the coefficients in the finite Fourier series for Lamé polynomials. § 29.15(i) includes formulas for normalizing the eigenvectors.

Zeros of Lamé polynomials can be computed by solving the system of equations ( 29.12.13 ) by employing Newton’s method; see § 3.8(ii) . Alternatively, the zeros can be found by locating the maximum of function $g$ in ( 29.12.11 ).
