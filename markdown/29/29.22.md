Annotations for §29.22 and Ch.29
:::

The following Maple programs were provided by the author.

[LA1](http://dlmf.nist.gov/29/22/software/LA1.mws) : Eigenvalues for Lamé functions.

[LA2](http://dlmf.nist.gov/29/22/software/LA2.mws) : Lamé functions.

[LA5](http://dlmf.nist.gov/29/22/software/LA5.mws) : Coefficients $\tau_{j}$ of the asymptotic expansions for the eigenvalues of the Lamé functions; see § 29.7(i) .

Precision in LA1 and LA2 is adjustable. Program LA5 uses symbolic algebra.
