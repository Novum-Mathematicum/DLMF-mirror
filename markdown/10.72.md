Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions are often used as approximants in the construction of uniform asymptotic approximations and expansions for solutions of linear second-order differential equations containing a parameter. The canonical form of differential equation for these problems is given by


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}w}{{\mathrm{d}z}^{2}}=\left(u^{2}f(z)+g(z)\right)w, \tag{10.72.1}
$$

where $z$ is a real or complex variable and $u$ is a large real or complex parameter.

In regions in which ( 10.72.1 ) has a simple turning point $z_{0}$ , that is, $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic (or with weaker conditions if $z=x$ is a real variable) and $z_{0}$ is a simple zero of $f(z)$ , asymptotic expansions of the solutions $w$ for large $u$ can be constructed in terms of Airy functions or equivalently Bessel functions or modified Bessel functions of order $\tfrac{1}{3}$ (§ 9.6(i) ). These expansions are uniform with respect to $z$ , including the turning point $z_{0}$ and its neighborhood, and the region of validity often includes cut neighborhoods (§ 1.10(vi) ) of other singularities of the differential equation, especially irregular singularities.

If $f(z)$ has a double zero $z_{0}$ , or more generally $z_{0}$ is a zero of order $m$ , $m=2,3,4,\dotsc$ , then uniform asymptotic approximations (but *not* expansions) can be constructed in terms of Bessel functions, or modified Bessel functions, of order $1/(m+2)$ . The number $m$ can also be replaced by any real constant $\lambda$ $(>-2)$ in the sense that $(z-z_{0})^{-\lambda}$ $f(z)$ is analytic and nonvanishing at $z_{0}$ ; moreover, $g(z)$ is permitted to have a single or double pole at $z_{0}$ . The order of the approximating Bessel functions, or modified Bessel functions, is $1/(\lambda+2)$ , except in the case when $g(z)$ has a double pole at $z_{0}$ . See § 2.8(v) for references.

In regions in which the function $f(z)$ has a simple pole at $z=z_{0}$ and $(z-z_{0})^{2}g(z)$ is analytic at $z=z_{0}$ (the case $\lambda=-1$ in § 10.72(i) ), asymptotic expansions of the solutions $w$ of ( 10.72.1 ) for large $u$ can be constructed in terms of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions of order $\pm\sqrt{1+4\rho}$ , where $\rho$ is the limiting value of $(z-z_{0})^{2}g(z)$ as $z\to z_{0}$ . These asymptotic expansions are uniform with respect to $z$ , including cut neighborhoods of $z_{0}$ , and again the region of uniformity often includes cut neighborhoods of other singularities of the differential equation.

In ( 10.72.1 ) assume $f(z)=f(z,\alpha)$ and $g(z)=g(z,\alpha)$ depend continuously on a real parameter $\alpha$ , $f(z,\alpha)$ has a simple zero $z=z_{0}(\alpha)$ and a double pole $z=0$ , except for a critical value $\alpha=a$ , where $z_{0}(a)=0$ . Assume that whether or not $\alpha=a$ , $z^{2}g(z,\alpha)$ is analytic at $z=0$ . Then for large $u$ asymptotic approximations of the solutions $w$ can be constructed in terms of Bessel functions, or modified Bessel functions, of variable order (in fact the order depends on $u$ and $\alpha$ ). These approximations are uniform with respect to both $z$ and $\alpha$ , including $z=z_{0}(a)$ , the cut neighborhood of $z=0$ , and $\alpha=a$ . See § 2.8(vi) for references.
