$T_{n}\left(x\right)$ is the denominator of the $n$ th approximant to:


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
\cfrac{-1}{x+\cfrac{-1}{2x+\cfrac{-1}{2x+}}}\cdots, \tag{18.13.1}
$$

and $U_{n}\left(x\right)$ is the denominator of the $n$ th approximant to:


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\cfrac{-1}{2x+\cfrac{-1}{2x+\cfrac{-1}{2x+}}}\cdots. \tag{18.13.2}

$P_{n}\left(x\right)$ is the denominator of the $n$ th approximant to:


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
\cfrac{a_{1}}{x+\cfrac{-\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{2}x+\cfrac{-\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{3}x+\cfrac{-\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{7}{4}x+}}}}\cdots, \tag{18.13.3}

$$
\cfrac{a_{1}}{1-x+\cfrac{-\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}(3-x)+\cfrac{-\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}(5-x)+\cfrac{-\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}(7-x)+}}}}\cdots, \tag{18.13.4}
