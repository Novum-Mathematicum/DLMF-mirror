The uniform asymptotic approximations given in § [14.15](./14.15.md "§14.15 Uniform Asymptotic Approximations ‣ Real Arguments ‣ Chapter 14 Legendre and Related Functions") for $P^{-\mu}_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}^{\mu}_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ for $1<x<\infty$ are extended to domains in the complex plane in the following references: §§ 14.15(i) and 14.15(ii) , Dunster ([2003b](./bib/D.html#bib712 "Uniform asymptotic expansions for associated Legendre functions of large order")); § 14.15(iii) , Olver ([1997b](./bib/O.html#bib1809 "Asymptotics and Special Functions"), Chapter 12); § 14.15(iv) , Boyd and Dunster ([1986](./bib/B.html#bib338 "Uniform asymptotic solutions of a class of second-order linear differential equations having a turning point and a regular singularity, with an application to Legendre functions")). For an extension of § 14.15(iv) to complex argument and imaginary parameters, see Dunster ([1990b](./bib/D.html#bib697 "Uniform asymptotic solutions of second-order linear differential equations having a double pole with complex exponent and a coalescing turning point")).
