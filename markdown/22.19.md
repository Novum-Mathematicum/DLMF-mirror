With appropriate scalings, Newton’s equation of motion for a pendulum with a mass in a gravitational field constrained to move in a vertical plane at a fixed distance from a fulcrum is


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}\theta(t)}{{\mathrm{d}t}^{2}}=-\sin\theta(t), \tag{22.19.1}
$$

$\theta$ being the angular displacement from the point of stable equilibrium, $\theta=0$ . The bounded $(-\pi\leq\theta\leq\pi)$ oscillatory solution of ( 22.19.1 ) is traditionally written


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\sin\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\theta(t)\right)=\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right)\operatorname{sn}\left(t+K,\sin\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha\right)\right), \tag{22.19.2}
$$

for an initial angular displacement $\alpha$ , with $\ifrac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}=0$ at time $0$ ; see Lawden ([1989](./bib/L.html#bib1385 "Elliptic Functions and Applications"), pp. 114–117). The period is $4K\left(\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right)\right)$ . The periodicity and symmetry of the pendulum imply that the motion in each four intervals $\theta\in(0,\pm\alpha)$ and $\theta\in(\pm\alpha,0)$ have the same “quarter periods” $K=K\left(\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right)\right)$ . Thus the offset $t+K$ in 22.19.2 as the motion starts $\theta(0)=\alpha$ , rather than $\theta(0)=0$ as in 22.19.3 , which follows. The angle $\alpha=\pi$ is a *separatrix* , separating oscillatory and unbounded motion. With the same initial conditions, if the sign of gravity is reversed then the new period is $4{K^{\prime}}\left(\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right)\right)$ ; see Whittaker ([1964](./bib/W.html#bib2403 "A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies"), §44).

Alternatively, Sala ([1989](./bib/S.html#bib1994 "Transformations of the Jacobian amplitude function and its calculation via the arithmetic-geometric mean")) writes:


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
\theta(t)=2\operatorname{am}\left(t\sqrt{E/2},\sqrt{2/E}\right), \tag{22.19.3}
$$

for the initial conditions $\theta(0)=0$ , the point of stable equilibrium for $E=0$ , and $\ifrac{\mathrm{d}\theta(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}=\sqrt{2E}$ . Here $E=\frac{1}{2}(\ifrac{\mathrm{d}\theta(t)}{\mathrm{d}t})^{2}+1-\cos\theta(t)$ is the *energy* , which is a first integral of the motion. This formulation gives the bounded and unbounded solutions from the same formula ( 22.19.3 ), for $k\geq 1$ and $k\leq 1$ , respectively. Also, $\theta(t)$ is not restricted to the principal range $-\pi\leq\theta\leq\pi$ . Figure 22.19.1 shows the nature of the solutions $\theta(t)$ of ( 22.19.3 ) by graphing $\operatorname{am}\left(x,k\right)$ for both $0\leq k\leq 1$ , as in Figure 22.16.1 , and $k\geq 1$ , where it is periodic.

When $k<1$ , $\operatorname{am}\left(x,k\right)$ increases monotonically indicating that the motion of the pendulum is unbounded in $\theta$ , corresponding to free rotation about the fulcrum; compare Figure 22.16.1 . As $k\to 1-$ , plateaus are seen as the motion approaches the separatrix where $\theta=n\pi$ , $n=\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots$ , at which points the motion is time independent for $k=1$ . This corresponds to the pendulum being “upside down” at a point of unstable equilibrium. For $k>1$ , the motion is periodic in $x$ , corresponding to bounded oscillatory motion.](../html/22/19/F1.png)

Classical motion in one dimension is described by Newton’s equation


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}x(t)}{{\mathrm{d}t}^{2}}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}V(x)}{\mathrm{d}x}, \tag{22.19.4}

where $V(x)$ is the potential energy, and $x(t)$ is the coordinate as a function of time $t$ . The potential

$$
V(x)=\pm\tfrac{1}{2}x^{2}\pm\tfrac{1}{4}\beta x^{4} \tag{22.19.5}

plays a prototypal role in classical mechanics (Lawden ([1989](./bib/L.html#bib1385 "Elliptic Functions and Applications"), §5.2)), quantum mechanics (Schulman ([1981](./bib/S.html#bib2022 "Techniques and Applications of Path Integration"), Chapter 29)), and quantum field theory (Pokorski ([1987](./bib/P.html#bib1887 "Gauge Field Theories"), p. 203), Parisi ([1988](./bib/P.html#bib1848 "Statistical Field Theory"), §14.6)). Its dynamics for purely imaginary time is connected to the theory of instantons (Itzykson and Zuber ([1980](./bib/I.html#bib1149 "Quantum Field Theory"), p. 572), Schäfer and Shuryak ([1998](./bib/S.html#bib2000 "Instantons in QCD"))), to WKB theory, and to large-order perturbation theory (Bender and Wu ([1973](./bib/B.html#bib235 "Anharmonic oscillator. II. A study of perturbation theory in large order")), Simon ([1982](./bib/S.html#bib2088 "Large orders and summability of eigenvalue perturbation theory: A mathematical overview"))).

For $\beta$ real and positive, three of the four possible combinations of signs give rise to bounded oscillatory motions. We consider the case of a particle of mass 1, initially held at rest at displacement $a$ from the origin and then released at time $t=0$ . The subsequent position as a function of time, $x(t)$ , for the three cases is given with results expressed in terms of $a$ and the dimensionless parameter $\eta=\frac{1}{2}\beta a^{2}$ .

This is an example of *Duffing’s equation* ; see Ablowitz and Clarkson ([1991](./bib/index.html#bib3 "Solitons, Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Inverse Scattering"), pp. 150–152) and Lawden ([1989](./bib/L.html#bib1385 "Elliptic Functions and Applications"), pp. 117–119). The subsequent time evolution is always oscillatory with period $4K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{1+2\eta}$ and modulus $k=1/\sqrt{2+\eta^{-1}}$ :

$$
x(t)=a\operatorname{cn}\left(t\sqrt{1+2\eta},k\right). \tag{22.19.6}

There is bounded oscillatory motion near $x=0$ , with period $4K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{1-\eta}$ , and modulus $k=1/\sqrt{\eta^{-1}-1}$ , for initial displacements with $|a|\leq\sqrt{1/\beta}$ .

x(t)=a\operatorname{sn}\left(t\sqrt{1-\eta},k\right). \tag{22.19.7}

As $a\to\sqrt{1/\beta}$ from below the period diverges since $a=\pm\sqrt{1/\beta}$ are points of unstable equilibrium.

Two corrections have been made in this paragraph. First, the correct range of the initial displacement $a$ is $\sqrt{1/\beta}\leq|a|<\sqrt{2/\beta}$ . Previously it was $\sqrt{1/\beta}\leq|a|\leq\sqrt{2/\beta}$ . Second, the correct period of the oscillations is $2K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{\eta}$ . Previously it was given incorrectly as $4K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{\eta}$ . *Reported 2014-04-28 by Svante Janson*

Two types of oscillatory motion are possible. For an initial displacement with $\sqrt{1/\beta}\leq|a|<\sqrt{2/\beta}$ , bounded oscillations take place near one of the two points of stable equilibrium $x=\pm\sqrt{1/\beta}$ . Such oscillations, of period $2K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{\eta}$ , with modulus $k=1/\sqrt{2-\eta^{-1}}$ are given by:


<a id="E8"></a>
$$
x(t)=a\operatorname{dn}\left(t\sqrt{\eta},k\right). \tag{22.19.8}
$$

As $a\to\sqrt{2/\beta}$ from below the period diverges since $x=0$ is a point of unstable equlilibrium. For initial displacement with $|a|\geq\sqrt{2/\beta}$ the motion extends over the full range $-a\leq x\leq a$ :


<a id="E9"></a>
$$
x(t)=a\operatorname{cn}\left(t\sqrt{2\eta-1},k\right), \tag{22.19.9}
$$

with period $4K\left(k\right)/\sqrt{2\eta-1}$ and modulus $k=1/\sqrt{2-\eta^{-1}}$ . As $\left|a\right|\to\sqrt{1/\beta}$ from above the period again diverges. Both the $\operatorname{dn}$ and $\operatorname{cn}$ solutions approach $a\operatorname{sech}t$ as $a\to\sqrt{2/\beta}$ from the appropriate directions.

Many nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations have solutions that may be expressed in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions. These include the time dependent, and time independent, nonlinear Schrödinger equations (NLSE) (Drazin and Johnson ([1993](./bib/D.html#bib684 "Solitons: An Introduction"), Chapter 2), Ablowitz and Clarkson ([1991](./bib/index.html#bib3 "Solitons, Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Inverse Scattering"), pp. 42, 99)), the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation (Kruskal ([1974](./bib/K.html#bib1353 "The Korteweg-de Vries Equation and Related Evolution Equations")), Li and Olver ([2000](./bib/L.html#bib1438 "Well-posedness and blow-up solutions for an integrable nonlinearly dispersive model wave equation"))), the sine-Gordon equation, and others; see Drazin and Johnson ([1993](./bib/D.html#bib684 "Solitons: An Introduction"), Chapter 2) for an overview. Such solutions include standing or stationary waves, periodic cnoidal waves, and single and multi-solitons occurring in diverse physical situations such as water waves, optical pulses, quantum fluids, and electrical impulses (Hasegawa ([1989](./bib/H.html#bib1054 "Optical Solitons in Fibers")), Carr et al. ([2000](./bib/C.html#bib455 "Stationary solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. I.

The classical rotation of rigid bodies in free space or about a fixed point may be described in terms of elliptic, or *hyperelliptic* , functions if the motion is *integrable* (Audin ([1999](./bib/index.html#bib165 "Spinning Tops: A Course on Integrable Systems"), Chapter 1)). Hyperelliptic functions $u(z)$ are solutions of the equation $z=\int_{0}^{u}(f(x))^{-1/2}\,\mathrm{d}x$ , where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree higher than 4. Elementary discussions of this topic appear in Lawden ([1989](./bib/L.html#bib1385 "Elliptic Functions and Applications"), §5.7), Greenhill ([1959](./bib/G.html#bib984 "The Applications of Elliptic Functions"), pp. 101–103), and Whittaker ([1964](./bib/W.html#bib2403 "A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies"), Chapter VI). A more abstract overview is Audin ([1999](./bib/index.html#bib165 "Spinning Tops: A Course on Integrable Systems"), Chapters III and IV), and a complete discussion of analytical solutions in the elliptic and hyperelliptic cases appears in Golubev ([1960](./bib/G.html#bib954 "Lectures on Integration of the Equations of Motion of a Rigid Body About a Fixed Point"), Chapters V and VII), the original hyperelliptic investigation being due to Kowalevski ([1889](./bib/K.html#bib1340 "Sur le problème de la rotation d’un corps solide autour d’un point fixe")).

Numerous other physical or engineering applications involving Jacobian elliptic functions, and their inverses, to problems of classical dynamics, electrostatics, and hydrodynamics appear in Bowman ([1953](./bib/B.html#bib325 "Introduction to Elliptic Functions with Applications"), Chapters VII and VIII) and Lawden ([1989](./bib/L.html#bib1385 "Elliptic Functions and Applications"), Chapter 5). Whittaker ([1964](./bib/W.html#bib2403 "A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies"), Chapter IV) enumerates the complete class of one-body classical mechanical problems that are solvable this way.
