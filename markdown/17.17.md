Annotations for Ch.17
:::

In exactly solved models in statistical mechanics (Baxter ([1981](./bib/B.html#bib220 "Rogers-Ramanujan identities in the hard hexagon model"), [1982](./bib/B.html#bib221 "Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics"))) the methods and identities of ¬ß [17.12](./17.12.md "¬ß17.12 Bailey Pairs ‚Ä£ Properties ‚Ä£ Chapter 17 ùëû-Hypergeometric and Related Functions") play a substantial role. See Berkovich and McCoy ([1998](./bib/B.html#bib238 "Rogers-Ramanujan Identities: A Century of Progress from Mathematics to Physics")) and Bethuel ([1998](./bib/B.html#bib270 "Vortices in Ginzburg-Landau Equations")) for recent surveys.

Quantum groups also apply $q$ -series extensively. Quantum groups are really not groups at all but certain Hopf algebras. They were given this name because they play a role in quantum physics analogous to the role of Lie groups and special functions in classical mechanics. See Kassel ([1995](./bib/K.html#bib1234 "Quantum Groups")).

A substantial literature on $q$ -deformed quantum-mechanical Schr√∂dinger equations has developed recently. It involves $q$ -generalizations of exponentials and Laguerre polynomials, and has been applied to the problems of the harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials. See Micu and Papp ([2005](./bib/M.html#bib1609 "Applying q -Laguerre polynomials to the derivation of q -deformed energies of oscillator and Coulomb systems")), where many earlier references are cited.
