Riemann theta functions arise in the study of *integrable differential equations* that have applications in many areas, including fluid mechanics (Ablowitz and Segur ([1981](./bib/index.html#bib5 "Solitons and the Inverse Scattering Transform"), Chapter 4)), magnetic monopoles (Ercolani and Sinha ([1989](./bib/E.html#bib744 "Monopoles and Baker functions"))), and string theory (Deligne et al. ([1999](./bib/D.html#bib648 "Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians. Vol. 1, 2"), Part 3)). Typical examples of such equations are the Korteweg–de Vries equation


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
4u_{t}=6uu_{x}+u_{xxx}, \tag{21.9.1}
$$

and the nonlinear Schrödinger equations


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
iu_{t}=-\tfrac{1}{2}u_{xx}\pm|u|^{2}u. \tag{21.9.2}
$$

Here, and in what follows, $x,y$ , and $t$ suffixes indicate partial derivatives.

Particularly important for the use of Riemann theta functions is the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) equation, which describes the propagation of two-dimensional, long-wave length surface waves in shallow water (Ablowitz and Segur ([1981](./bib/index.html#bib5 "Solitons and the Inverse Scattering Transform"), Chapter 4)):


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
(-4u_{t}+6uu_{x}+u_{xxx})_{x}+3u_{yy}=0. \tag{21.9.3}
$$

Here $x$ and $y$ are spatial variables, $t$ is time, and $u(x,y,t)$ is the elevation of the surface wave. All quantities are made dimensionless by a suitable scaling transformation. The KP equation has a class of quasi-periodic solutions described by Riemann theta functions, given by


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
u(x,y,t)=c+2\frac{{\partial}^{2}}{{\partial x}^{2}}\ln\left(\theta\left(\mathbf{k}x+\mathbf{l}y+\boldsymbol{{\omega}}t+\boldsymbol{{\phi}}\middle|\boldsymbol{{\Omega}}\right)\right), \tag{21.9.4}
$$

where $c$ is a complex constant and $\mathbf{k}$ , $\mathbf{l}$ , $\boldsymbol{{\omega}}$ , and $\boldsymbol{{\phi}}$ are $g$ -dimensional complex vectors; see Krichever ([1976](./bib/K.html#bib1349 "An algebraic-geometrical construction of the Zakharov-Shabat equations and their periodic solutions")). These parameters, including $\boldsymbol{{\Omega}}$ , are not free: they are determined by a compact, connected Riemann surface (Krichever ([1976](./bib/K.html#bib1349 "An algebraic-geometrical construction of the Zakharov-Shabat equations and their periodic solutions"))), or alternatively by an appropriate initial condition $u(x,y,0)$ (Deconinck and Segur ([1998](./bib/D.html#bib633 "The KP equation with quasiperiodic initial data"))). These solutions have been compared successfully with physical experiments for $g=1,2$ (Wiegel ([1960](./bib/W.html#bib2408 "A presentation of cnoidal wave theory for practical application")), Hammack et al. ([1989](./bib/H.html#bib1031 "Two-dimensional periodic waves in shallow water")), and Hammack et al. ([1995](./bib/H.html#bib1030 "Two-dimensional periodic waves in shallow water. II. Asymmetric waves"))). See Figures 21.9.1 and 21.9.2 .

Furthermore, the solutions of the KP equation solve the *Schottky problem* : this is the question concerning conditions that a Riemann matrix needs to satisfy in order to be associated with a Riemann surface (Schottky ([1903](./bib/S.html#bib2019 "Über die Moduln der Thetafunctionen"))). Following the work of Krichever ([1976](./bib/K.html#bib1349 "An algebraic-geometrical construction of the Zakharov-Shabat equations and their periodic solutions")), Novikov conjectured that the Riemann theta function in ( 21.9.4 ) gives rise to a solution of the KP equation ( 21.9.3 ) if, and only if, the theta function originates from a Riemann surface; see Dubrovin ([1981](./bib/D.html#bib685 "Theta functions and non-linear equations"), §IV.4). The first part of this conjecture was established in Krichever ([1976](./bib/K.html#bib1349 "An algebraic-geometrical construction of the Zakharov-Shabat equations and their periodic solutions")); the second part was proved in Shiota ([1986](./bib/S.html#bib2068 "Characterization of Jacobian varieties in terms of soliton equations")).
