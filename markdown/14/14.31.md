Applications of toroidal functions include expansion of vacuum magnetic fields in stellarators and tokamaks (van Milligen and López Fraguas ([1994](./bib/V.html#bib2319 "Expansion of vacuum magnetic fields in toroidal harmonics"))), analytic solutions of Poisson’s equation in channel-like geometries (Hoyles et al. ([1998](./bib/H.html#bib1105 "Solutions of Poisson’s equation in channel-like geometries"))), and Dirichlet problems with toroidal symmetry (Gil et al. ([2000](./bib/G.html#bib920 "Computing toroidal functions for wide ranges of the parameters"))).

The conical functions $\mathsf{P}^{m}_{-\frac{1}{2}+i\tau}\left(x\right)$ appear in boundary-value problems for the Laplace equation in toroidal coordinates (§ 14.19(i) ) for regions bounded by cones, by two intersecting spheres, or by one or two confocal hyperboloids of revolution (Kölbig ([1981](./bib/K.html#bib1315 "A Program for Computing the Conical Functions of the First Kind ⁢ P m + - / 1 2 ⁢ i τ ( x ) for = m 0 and = m 1"))). These functions are also used in the Mehler–Fock integral transform (§ 14.20(vi) ) for problems in potential and heat theory, and in elementary particle physics (Sneddon ([1972](./bib/S.html#bib2130 "The Use of Integral Transforms"), Chapter 7) and Braaksma and Meulenbeld ([1967](./bib/B.html#bib340 "Integral transforms with generalized Legendre functions as kernels"))). The conical functions and Mehler–Fock transform generalize to Jacobi functions and the Jacobi transform; see Koornwinder ([1984a](./bib/K.html#bib1327 "Jacobi Functions and Analysis on Noncompact Semisimple Lie Groups")) and references therein.

Many additional physical applications of Legendre polynomials and associated Legendre functions include solution of the Helmholtz equation, as well as the Laplace equation, in spherical coordinates (Temme ([1996b](./bib/T.html#bib2230 "Special Functions: An Introduction to the Classical Functions of Mathematical Physics"))), quantum mechanics (Edmonds ([1974](./bib/E.html#bib727 "Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics"))), and high-frequency scattering by a sphere (Nussenzveig ([1965](./bib/N.html#bib1738 "High-frequency scattering by an impenetrable sphere"))). See also § [18.39](./18.39.md "§18.39 Applications in the Physical Sciences ‣ Applications ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") .

Legendre functions $P_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ of complex degree $\nu$ appear in the application of complex angular momentum techniques to atomic and molecular scattering (Connor and Mackay ([1979](./bib/C.html#bib569 "Calculation of angular distributions in complex angular momentum theories of elastic scattering"))).
