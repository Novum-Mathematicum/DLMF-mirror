$$
\left(1-z^{2}\right)\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}w}{{\mathrm{d}z}^{2}}-2z\frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}z}+{\left(\nu(\nu+1)-\frac{\mu_{1}^{2}}{2(1-z)}-\frac{\mu_{2}^{2}}{2(1+z)}\right)w}=0 \tag{14.29.1}
$$

are called *Generalized Associated Legendre Functions* . As in the case of ( 14.21.1 ), the solutions are hypergeometric functions, and ( 14.29.1 ) reduces to ( 14.21.1 ) when $\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu$ . For properties see Virchenko and Fedotova ([2001](./bib/V.html#bib2337 "Generalized Associated Legendre Functions and their Applications")) and Braaksma and Meulenbeld ([1967](./bib/B.html#bib340 "Integral transforms with generalized Legendre functions as kernels")).

For inhomogeneous versions of the associated Legendre equation, and properties of their solutions, see Babister ([1967](./bib/B.html#bib166 "Transcendental Functions Satisfying Nonhomogeneous Linear Differential Equations"), pp. 252–264).
