For small values of $\|\mathbf{T}\|$ the zonal polynomial expansion given by ( 35.8.1 ) can be summed numerically. For large $\|\mathbf{T}\|$ the asymptotic approximations referred to in ยง 35.7(iv) are available.

Other methods include numerical quadrature applied to double and multiple integral representations. See Yan ([1992](./bib/Y.html#bib2467 "Generalized Hypergeometric Functions and Laguerre Polynomials in Two Variables")) for the ${{}_{1}F_{1}}$ and ${{}_{2}F_{1}}$ functions of matrix argument in the case $m=2$ , and Bingham et al. ([1992](./bib/B.html#bib285 "Approximating the matrix Fisher and Bingham distributions: Applications to spherical regression and Procrustes analysis")) for Monte Carlo simulation on $\mathbf{O}(m)$ applied to a generalization of the integral ( 35.5.8 ).

Koev and Edelman ([2006](./bib/K.html#bib1306 "The efficient evaluation of the hypergeometric function of a matrix argument")) utilizes combinatorial identities for the zonal polynomials to develop computational algorithms for approximating the series expansion ( 35.8.1 ). These algorithms are extremely efficient, converge rapidly even for large values of $m$ , and have complexity linear in $m$ .
