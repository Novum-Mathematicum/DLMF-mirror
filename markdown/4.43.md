§1.11(iii) , §3.8(iv) , Erratum (V1.0.10) for Section 4.43

**Errata (effective with 1.0.10):**

The first paragraph of this section has been rewritten to correct reported errors. The constants $C=(-\frac{27q^{2}}{4p^{3}})^{1/2}$ and $D=-(\frac{27q^{2}}{4p^{3}})^{1/2}$ , formerly given in Eq. ( 4.43.1 ) for use in Cases (a), (b), and (c) of Eq. ( 4.43.2 ), have been eliminated, and these three cases have been corrected. Formerly they read (a) $A\sin a$ , $A\sin\left(a+\frac{2}{3}\pi\right)$ , and $A\sin\left(a+\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)$ , with $\sin\left(3a\right)=C$ , when $p<0$ and $C\leq 1$ . (b) $A\cosh a$ , $A\cosh\left(a+\frac{2}{3}\pi i\right)$ , and $A\cosh\left(a+\frac{4}{3}\pi i\right)$ , with $\cosh\left(3a\right)=C$ , when $p<0$ and $C>1$ . (c) $B\sinh a$ , $B\sinh\left(a+\frac{2}{3}\pi i\right)$ , and $B\sinh\left(a+\frac{4}{3}\pi i\right)$ , with $\sinh\left(3a\right)=D$ , when $p>0$ . *Reported 2014-10-31 by Masataka Urago*

Let $p(\neq 0)$ and $q$ be real constants and

$$
\displaystyle A \displaystyle=\left(-\tfrac{4}{3}p\right)^{1/2}, \tag{4.43.1}

$$
\displaystyle B \displaystyle=\left(\tfrac{4}{3}p\right)^{1/2}.

The roots of

z^{3}+pz+q=0 \tag{4.43.2}
$$

are:

Note that in Case (a) all the roots are real, whereas in Cases (b) and (c) there is one real root and a conjugate pair of complex roots. See also § 1.11(iii) .
