* Hastings ([1955](./bib/H.html#bib1056 "Approximations for Digital Computers")) gives several minimax polynomial and rational approximations for $E_{1}\left(x\right)+\ln x$ , $xe^{x}E_{1}\left(x\right)$ , and the auxiliary functions $\mathrm{f}\left(x\right)$ and $\mathrm{g}\left(x\right)$ . These are included in Abramowitz and Stegun ([1964](./bib/index.html#bib24 "Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables"), Ch. 5).
* Cody and Thacher ([1968](./bib/C.html#bib553 "Rational Chebyshev approximations for the exponential integral ⁢ E 1 ( x )")) provides minimax rational approximations for $E_{1}\left(x\right)$ , with accuracies up to 20S.
* Cody and Thacher ([1969](./bib/C.html#bib554 "Chebyshev approximations for the exponential integral ⁢ Ei ( x )")) provides minimax rational approximations for $\operatorname{Ei}\left(x\right)$ , with accuracies up to 20S.
* MacLeod ([1996b](./bib/M.html#bib1525 "Rational approximations, software and test methods for sine and cosine integrals")) provides rational approximations for the sine and cosine integrals and for the auxiliary functions $\mathrm{f}$ and $\mathrm{g}$ , with accuracies up to 20S.

* Clenshaw ([1962](./bib/C.html#bib525 "Chebyshev Series for Mathematical Functions")) gives Chebyshev coefficients for $-E_{1}\left(x\right)-\ln|x|$ for $-4\leq x\leq 4$ and $e^{x}E_{1}\left(x\right)$ for $x\geq 4$ (20D).
* Luke and Wimp ([1963](./bib/L.html#bib1493 "Jacobi polynomial expansions of a generalized hypergeometric function over a semi-infinite ray")) covers $\operatorname{Ei}\left(x\right)$ for $x\leq-4$ (20D), and $\operatorname{Si}\left(x\right)$ and $\operatorname{Ci}\left(x\right)$ for $x\geq 4$ (20D).
* Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2"), pp. 41–42) gives Chebyshev expansions of $\operatorname{Ein}\left(ax\right)$ , $\operatorname{Si}\left(ax\right)$ , and $\operatorname{Cin}\left(ax\right)$ for $-1\leq x\leq 1$ , $a\in\mathbb{C}$ . The coefficients are given in terms of series of Bessel functions.
* Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2"), pp. 321–322) covers $\operatorname{Ein}\left(x\right)$ and $-\operatorname{Ein}\left(-x\right)$ for $0\leq x\leq 8$ (the Chebyshev coefficients are given to 20D); $E_{1}\left(x\right)$ for $x\geq 5$ (20D), and $\operatorname{Ei}\left(x\right)$ for $x\geq 8$ (15D). Coefficients for the sine and cosine integrals are given on pp. 325–327.
* Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2"), p. 25) gives a Chebyshev expansion near infinity for the confluent hypergeometric $U$ -function (§ 13.2(i) ) from which Chebyshev expansions near infinity for $E_{1}\left(z\right)$ , $\mathrm{f}\left(z\right)$ , and $\mathrm{g}\left(z\right)$ follow by using ( 6.11.2 ) and ( 6.11.3 ). Luke also includes a recursion scheme for computing the coefficients in the expansions of the $U$ functions. If $|\operatorname{ph}z|<\pi$ the scheme can be used in backward direction.

* Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2"), pp. 402, 410, and 415–421) gives main diagonal Padé approximations for $\operatorname{Ein}\left(z\right)$ , $\operatorname{Si}\left(z\right)$ , $\operatorname{Cin}\left(z\right)$ (valid near the origin), and $E_{1}\left(z\right)$ (valid for large $|z|$ ); approximate errors are given for a selection of $z$ -values.
* Luke ([1969b](./bib/L.html#bib1496 "The Special Functions and their Approximations. Vol. 2"), pp. 411–414) gives rational approximations for $\operatorname{Ein}\left(z\right)$ .
