For small or moderate values of $x$ and $|z|$ , the expansion in power series (§ [6.6](./6.6.md "§6.6 Power Series ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 6 Exponential, Logarithmic, Sine, and Cosine Integrals") ) or in series of spherical Bessel functions (§ 6.10(ii) ) can be used. For large $x$ or $|z|$ these series suffer from slow convergence or cancellation (or both). However, this problem is less severe for the series of spherical Bessel functions because of their more rapid rate of convergence, and also (except in the case of ( 6.10.6 )) absence of cancellation when $z=x$ ( $>0$ ).

For large $x$ and $\left|z\right|$ , expansions in inverse factorial series (§ 6.10(i) ) or asymptotic expansions (§ [6.12](./6.12.md "§6.12 Asymptotic Expansions ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 6 Exponential, Logarithmic, Sine, and Cosine Integrals") ) are available. The attainable accuracy of the asymptotic expansions can be increased considerably by exponential improvement. Also, other ranges of $\operatorname{ph}z$ can be covered by use of the continuation formulas of § [6.4](./6.4.md "§6.4 Analytic Continuation ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 6 Exponential, Logarithmic, Sine, and Cosine Integrals") .

Quadrature of the integral representations is another effective method. For example, the Gauss–Laguerre formula (§ 3.5(v) ) can be applied to ( 6.2.2 ); see Todd ([1954](./bib/T.html#bib2256 "Evaluation of the exponential integral for large complex arguments")) and Tseng and Lee ([1998](./bib/T.html#bib2283 "Numerical evaluation of exponential integral: Theis well function approximation")). For an application of the Gauss–Legendre formula (§ 3.5(v) ) see Tooper and Mark ([1968](./bib/T.html#bib2263 "Simplified calculation of ⁢ Ei ( x ) for positive arguments, and a short table of ⁢ Shi ( x )")).

Lastly, the continued fraction ( 6.9.1 ) can be used if $|z|$ is bounded away from the origin. Convergence becomes slow when $z$ is near the negative real axis, however.

Power series, asymptotic expansions, and quadrature can also be used to compute the functions $\mathrm{f}\left(z\right)$ and $\mathrm{g}\left(z\right)$ . In addition, Acton ([1974](./bib/index.html#bib27 "Recurrence relations for the Fresnel integral ∫ 0 ∞ ⁢ exp ( - ⁢ c t ) d t ⁢ t ( + 1 t 2 ) and similar integrals")) developed a recurrence procedure, as follows. For $n=0,1,2,\dots$ , define

<a id="E1"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle A_{n} \displaystyle=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{te^{-zt}}{1+t^{2}}\left(\frac{t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}t, \tag{6.18.1}
$$

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle B_{n} \displaystyle=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-zt}}{1+t^{2}}\left(\frac{t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}t,
$$

<a id="Ex3"></a>
$$
\displaystyle C_{n} \displaystyle=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-zt}\left(\frac{t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}t.

$A_{0}$ , $B_{0}$ , and $C_{0}$ can be computed by Miller’s algorithm (§ 3.6(iii) ), starting with initial values $(A_{N},B_{N},C_{N})=(1,0,0)$ , say, where $N$ is an arbitrary large integer, and normalizing via $C_{0}=1/z$ .

Zeros of $\operatorname{Ci}\left(x\right)$ and $\operatorname{si}\left(x\right)$ can be computed to high precision by Newton’s rule (§ 3.8(ii) ), using values supplied by the asymptotic expansion ( 6.13.2 ) as initial approximations.
