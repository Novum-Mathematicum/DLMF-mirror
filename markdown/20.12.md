The space of complex tori $\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z})$ (that is, the set of complex numbers $z$ in which two of these numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are regarded as equivalent if there exist integers $m,n$ such that $z_{1}-z_{2}=m+\tau n$ ) is mapped into the projective space $P^{3}$ via the identification $z\to(\theta_{1}\left(2z\middle|\tau\right),\theta_{2}\left(2z\middle|\tau\right),\theta_{3}\left(2z\middle|\tau\right),\theta_{4}\left(2z\middle|\tau\right))$ . Thus theta functions “uniformize” the complex torus. This ability to uniformize multiply-connected spaces (manifolds), or multi-sheeted functions of a complex variable (Riemann ([1899](./bib/R.html#bib1952 "Elliptische Functionen")), Rauch and Lebowitz ([1973](./bib/R.html#bib1928 "Elliptic Functions, Theta Functions, and Riemann Surfaces")), Siegel ([1988](./bib/S.html#bib2080 "Topics in Complex Function Theory. Vol. I: Elliptic Functions and Uniformization Theory"))) has led to applications in string theory (Green et al. ([1988a](./bib/G.html#bib979 "Superstring Theory: Introduction, Vol. 1"), [b](./bib/G.html#bib980 "Superstring Theory: Loop Amplitudes, Anomalies and Phenomenolgy, Vol. 2")), Krichever and Novikov ([1989](./bib/K.html#bib1350 "Algebras of Virasoro type, the energy-momentum tensor, and operator expansions on Riemann surfaces"))), and also in statistical mechanics (Baxter ([1982](./bib/B.html#bib221 "Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics"))).
