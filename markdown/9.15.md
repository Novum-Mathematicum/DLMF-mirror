Annotations for Ch.9
:::

Airy functions play an indispensable role in the construction of uniform asymptotic expansions for contour integrals with coalescing saddle points, and for solutions of linear second-order ordinary differential equations with a simple turning point. For descriptions of, and references to, the underlying theory see §§ 2.4(v) and 2.8(iii) .
