Numerical differences between the variables of a symmetric integral can be reduced in magnitude by successive factors of 4 by repeated applications of the duplication theorem, as shown by ( 19.26.18 ). When the differences are moderately small, the iteration is stopped, the elementary symmetric functions of certain differences are calculated, and a polynomial consisting of a fixed number of terms of the sum in ( 19.19.7 ) is evaluated. For $R_{F}$ the polynomial of degree 7, for example, is


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
1-\tfrac{1}{10}E_{2}+\tfrac{1}{14}E_{3}+\tfrac{1}{24}E_{2}^{2}-\tfrac{3}{44}E_{2}E_{3}-\tfrac{5}{208}E_{2}^{3}+\tfrac{3}{104}E_{3}^{2}+\tfrac{1}{16}E_{2}^{2}E_{3}, \tag{19.36.1}
$$

where the elementary symmetric functions $E_{s}$ are defined by ( 19.19.4 ). If ( 19.36.1 ) is used instead of its first five terms, then the factor $(3r)^{-1/6}$ in Carlson ([1995](./bib/C.html#bib441 "Numerical computation of real or complex elliptic integrals"), (2.2)) is changed to $(3r)^{-1/8}$ .

For both $R_{D}$ and $R_{J}$ the factor $(r/4)^{-1/6}$ in Carlson ([1995](./bib/C.html#bib441 "Numerical computation of real or complex elliptic integrals"), (2.18)) is changed to $(r/5)^{-1/8}$ when the following polynomial of degree 7 (the same for both) is used instead of its first seven terms:


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
1-\tfrac{3}{14}E_{2}+\tfrac{1}{6}E_{3}+\tfrac{9}{88}E_{2}^{2}-\tfrac{3}{22}E_{4}-\tfrac{9}{52}E_{2}E_{3}+\tfrac{3}{26}E_{5}-\tfrac{1}{16}E_{2}^{3}+\tfrac{3}{40}E_{3}^{2}+\tfrac{3}{20}E_{2}E_{4}+\tfrac{45}{272}E_{2}^{2}E_{3}-\tfrac{9}{68}(E_{3}E_{4}+E_{2}E_{5}). \tag{19.36.2}
$$

Polynomials of still higher degree can be obtained from ( 19.19.5 ) and ( 19.19.7 ).

The duplication method starts with computation of $\lambda_{0}=\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{y}\sqrt{z}+\sqrt{z}\sqrt{x}$ . The reductions in § 19.29(i) represent $x,y,z$ as squares, for example $x=U_{12}^{2}$ in ( 19.29.4 ). Because $U_{12}$ may be real and negative, or even complex, care is needed to ensure $\sqrt{x}=U_{12}$ , and similarly for $y$ and $z$ . This precaution is needed only for $\lambda_{0}$ . Alternatively, the first duplication is done analytically as in Carlson and FitzSimons ([2000](./bib/C.html#bib450 "Reduction theorems for elliptic integrands with the square root of two quadratic factors")), where further information can be found.

$$

$$

All cases of $R_{F}$ , $R_{C}$ , $R_{J}$ , and $R_{D}$ are computed by essentially the same procedure (after transforming Cauchy principal values by means of ( 19.20.14 ) and ( 19.2.20 )). Complex values of the variables are allowed, with some restrictions in the case of $R_{J}$ that are sufficient but not always necessary. The computation is slowest for complete cases. For details see Carlson ([1995](./bib/C.html#bib441 "Numerical computation of real or complex elliptic integrals"), [2002](./bib/C.html#bib444 "Three improvements in reduction and computation of elliptic integrals")) and Carlson and FitzSimons ([2000](./bib/C.html#bib450 "Reduction theorems for elliptic integrands with the square root of two quadratic factors")). In the Appendix of the last reference it is shown how to compute $R_{J}$ without computing $R_{C}$ more than once. Because of cancellations in ( 19.26.21 ) it is advisable to compute $R_{G}$ from $R_{F}$ and $R_{D}$ by ( 19.21.10 ) or else to use § 19.36(ii) .

Legendre’s integrals can be computed from symmetric integrals by using the relations in § 19.25(i) . Note the remark following ( 19.25.11 ). If ( 19.25.9 ) is used when $0\leq k^{2}\leq 1$ , cancellations may lead to loss of significant figures when $k^{2}$ is close to 1 and $\phi>\pi/4$ , as shown by Reinsch and Raab ([2000](./bib/R.html#bib1940 "Elliptic Integrals of the First and Second Kind – Comparison of Bulirsch’s and Carlson’s Algorithms for Numerical Calculation")). The cancellations can be eliminated, however, by using ( 19.25.10 ).

Accurate values of $F\left(\phi,k\right)-E\left(\phi,k\right)$ for $k^{2}$ near 0 can be obtained from $R_{D}$ by ( 19.2.6 ) and ( 19.25.13 ).

**Notes:**

See Carlson ([1965](./bib/C.html#bib428 "On computing elliptic integrals and functions"), (3.1), (3.2), Sections 5, 6). To obtain ( 19.36.6 ) and ( 19.36.8 ) from ( 19.22.18 ), let $(x^{2},y^{2},z^{2})=(t_{n}^{2},t_{n}^{2}+\theta c_{n}^{2},t_{n}^{2}+\theta a_{n}^{2})$ and $(a^{2},z_{-}^{2},z_{+}^{2})=(t_{n+1}^{2},t_{n+1}^{2}+\theta c_{n+1}^{2},t_{n+1}^{2}+\theta a_{n+1}^{2})$ . Then use the expression for $z_{\pm}^{2}-a^{2}$ from ( 19.22.17 ) and the definition of $a$ from ( 19.22.16 ).

:::

Complete cases of Legendre’s integrals and symmetric integrals can be computed with quadratic convergence by the AGM method (including Bartky transformations), using the equations in § 19.8(i) and § 19.22(ii) , respectively.

The incomplete integrals $R_{F}\left(x,y,z\right)$ and $R_{G}\left(x,y,z\right)$ can be computed by successive transformations in which two of the three variables converge quadratically to a common value and the integrals reduce to $R_{C}$ , accompanied by two quadratically convergent series in the case of $R_{G}$ ; compare Carlson ([1965](./bib/C.html#bib428 "On computing elliptic integrals and functions"), §§5,6). (In Legendre’s notation the modulus $k$ approaches 0 or 1.) Let

Then ( 19.22.18 ) implies that


<a id="E8"></a>
$$
R_{F}\left(t_{n}^{2},t_{n}^{2}+\theta c_{n}^{2},t_{n}^{2}+\theta a_{n}^{2}\right) \tag{19.36.8}
$$

is independent of $n$ . As $n\to\infty$ , $c_{n}$ , $a_{n}$ , and $t_{n}$ converge quadratically to limits $0$ , $M$ , and $T$ , respectively; hence


<a id="E9"></a>
$$
R_{F}\left(t_{0}^{2},t_{0}^{2}+\theta c_{0}^{2},t_{0}^{2}+\theta a_{0}^{2}\right)=R_{F}\left(T^{2},T^{2},T^{2}+\theta M^{2}\right)=R_{C}\left(T^{2}+\theta M^{2},T^{2}\right). \tag{19.36.9}
$$

If $t_{0}=a_{0}$ and $\theta=-1$ , so that $t_{n}=a_{n}$ , then this procedure reduces to the AGM method for the complete integral.

The step from $n$ to $n+1$ is an ascending Landen transformation if $\theta=1$ (leading ultimately to a hyperbolic case of $R_{C}$ ) or a descending Gauss transformation if $\theta=-1$ (leading to a circular case of $R_{C}$ ). If $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are permuted so that $0\leq x<y<z$ , then the computation of $R_{F}\left(x,y,z\right)$ is fastest if we make $c_{0}^{2}\leq a_{0}^{2}/2$ by choosing $\theta=1$ when $y<(x+z)/2$ or $\theta=-1$ when $y\geq(x+z)/2$ .

in agreement with ( 19.36.5 ). Here $R_{C}$ is computed either by the duplication algorithm in Carlson ([1995](./bib/C.html#bib441 "Numerical computation of real or complex elliptic integrals")) or via ( 19.2.19 ).

If the iteration of ( 19.36.6 ) and ( 19.36.12 ) is stopped when $c_{s}<\sqrt{r}t_{s}$ ( $M$ and $T$ being approximated by $a_{s}$ and $t_{s}$ , and the infinite series being truncated), then the relative error in $R_{F}$ and $R_{G}$ is less than $r$ if we neglect terms of order $r^{2}$ .

$F\left(\phi,k\right)$ can be evaluated by using ( 19.25.5 ). $E\left(\phi,k\right)$ can be evaluated by using ( 19.25.7 ), and $R_{D}$ by using ( 19.21.10 ), but cancellations may become significant. Thompson ([1997](./bib/T.html#bib2248 "Atlas for Computing Mathematical Functions: An Illustrated Guide for Practitioners"), pp. 499, 504) uses descending Landen transformations for both $F\left(\phi,k\right)$ and $E\left(\phi,k\right)$ . A summary for $F\left(\phi,k\right)$ is given in Gautschi ([1975](./bib/G.html#bib882 "Computational Methods in Special Functions – A Survey"), §3). For computation of $K\left(k\right)$ and $E\left(k\right)$ with complex $k$ see Fettis and Caslin ([1969](./bib/F.html#bib787 "A Table of the Complete Elliptic Integral of the First Kind for Complex Values of the Modulus. Part I")) and Morita ([1978](./bib/M.html#bib1656 "Calculation of the complete elliptic integrals with complex modulus")).

( 19.22.20 ) reduces to $0=0$ if $p=x$ or $p=y$ , and ( 19.22.19 ) reduces to $0=0$ if $z=x$ or $z=y$ . Near these points there will be loss of significant figures in the computation of $R_{J}$ or $R_{D}$ .

Descending Gauss transformations of $\Pi\left(\phi,\alpha^{2},k\right)$ (see ( 19.8.20 )) are used in Fettis ([1965](./bib/F.html#bib783 "Calculation of elliptic integrals of the third kind by means of Gauss’ transformation")) to compute a large table (see § 19.37(iii) ). This method loses significant figures in $\rho$ if $\alpha^{2}$ and $k^{2}$ are nearly equal unless they are given exact values—as they can be for tables. If $\alpha^{2}=k^{2}$ , then the method fails, but the function can be expressed by ( 19.6.13 ) in terms of $E\left(\phi,k\right)$ , for which Neuman ([1969b](./bib/N.html#bib1710 "On the calculation of elliptic integrals of the second and third kinds")) uses ascending Landen transformations.

Computation of Legendre’s integrals of all three kinds by quadratic transformation is described by Cazenave ([1969](./bib/C.html#bib461 "Intégrales et Fonctions Elliptiques en Vue des Applications"), pp. 128–159, 208–230).

Quadratic transformations can be applied to compute Bulirsch’s integrals (§ 19.2(iii) ). The function $\operatorname{cel}\left(k_{c},p,a,b\right)$ is computed by successive Bartky transformations (Bulirsch and Stoer ([1968](./bib/B.html#bib378 "II. Darstellung von Funktionen in Rechenautomaten")), Bulirsch ([1969b](./bib/B.html#bib376 "Numerical calculation of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions. III"))). The function $\operatorname{el2}\left(x,k_{c},a,b\right)$ is computed by descending Landen transformations if $x$ is real, or by descending Gauss transformations if $x$ is complex (Bulirsch ([1965b](./bib/B.html#bib372 "Numerical calculation of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions"))). Remedies for cancellation when $x$ is real and near 0 are supplied in Midy ([1975](./bib/M.html#bib1607 "An improved calculation of the general elliptic integral of the second kind in the neighbourhood of = x 0")). See also Bulirsch ([1969a](./bib/B.html#bib375 "An extension of the Bartky-transformation to incomplete elliptic integrals of the third kind")) and Reinsch and Raab ([2000](./bib/R.html#bib1940 "Elliptic Integrals of the First and Second Kind – Comparison of Bulirsch’s and Carlson’s Algorithms for Numerical Calculation")).

Bulirsch ([1969a](./bib/B.html#bib375 "An extension of the Bartky-transformation to incomplete elliptic integrals of the third kind"), [b](./bib/B.html#bib376 "Numerical calculation of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions. III")) extend Bartky’s transformation to $\operatorname{el3}\left(x,k_{c},p\right)$ by expressing it in terms of the first incomplete integral, a complete integral of the third kind, and a more complicated integral to which Bartky’s method can be applied. The cases $k_{c}^{2}/2\leq p<\infty$ and $-\infty<p<k_{c}^{2}/2$ require different treatment for numerical purposes, and again precautions are needed to avoid cancellations.

Annotations for §19.36 and Ch.19
:::

Numerical quadrature is slower than most methods for the standard integrals but can be useful for elliptic integrals that have complicated representations in terms of standard integrals. See § [3.5](./3.5.md "§3.5 Quadrature ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") .

For series expansions of Legendre’s integrals see § [19.5](./19.5.md "§19.5 Maclaurin and Related Expansions ‣ Legendre’s Integrals ‣ Chapter 19 Elliptic Integrals") . Faster convergence of power series for $K\left(k\right)$ and $E\left(k\right)$ can be achieved by using ( 19.5.1 ) and ( 19.5.2 ) in the right-hand sides of ( 19.8.12 ). A three-part computational procedure for $\Pi\left(\phi,\alpha^{2},k\right)$ is described by Franke ([1965](./bib/F.html#bib831 "Numerical evaluation of the elliptic integral of the third kind")) for $\alpha^{2}<1$ .

When the values of complete integrals are known, addition theorems with $\psi=\pi/2$ (§ 19.11(ii) ) ease the computation of functions such as $F\left(\phi,k\right)$ when $\frac{1}{2}\pi-\phi$ is small and positive. Similarly, § 19.26(ii) eases the computation of functions such as $R_{F}\left(x,y,z\right)$ when $x$ ( $>0$ ) is small compared with $\min(y,z)$ . These special theorems are also useful for checking computer codes.

For fast methods for computing the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind see Karp and Sitnik ([2007](./bib/K.html#bib2775 "Asymptotic approximations for the first incomplete elliptic integral near logarithmic singularity")) and Fukushima ([2010](./bib/F.html#bib2776 "Fast computation of incomplete elliptic integral of first kind by half argument transformation")).
