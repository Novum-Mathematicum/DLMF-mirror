In this section we provide links to the research literature describing the implementation of algorithms in software for the evaluation of functions described in this chapter. However, in some cases no research software has been found. For other software see the [Software Index](./software/index.md) .

For another listing of Web-accessible software for the functions in this chapter, see [GAMS (class C13)](https://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Class/C13/) .
