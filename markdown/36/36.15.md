Close to the origin $\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{{0}}$ of parameter space, the series in § [36.8](./36.8.md "§36.8 Convergent Series Expansions ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles") can be used.

Far from the bifurcation set, the leading-order asymptotic formulas of § [36.11](./36.11.md "§36.11 Leading-Order Asymptotics ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles") reproduce accurately the form of the function, including the geometry of the zeros described in § [36.7](./36.7.md "§36.7 Zeros ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles") . Close to the bifurcation set but far from $\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{{0}}$ , the uniform asymptotic approximations of § [36.12](./36.12.md "§36.12 Uniform Approximation of Integrals ‣ Applications ‣ Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles") can be used.

:::

Direct numerical evaluation can be carried out along a contour that runs along the segment of the real $t$ -axis containing all real critical points of $\Phi$ and is deformed outside this range so as to reach infinity along the asymptotic valleys of $\exp\left(i\Phi\right)$ . (For the umbilics, representations as one-dimensional integrals (§ [36.2](./36.2.md "§36.2 Catastrophes and Canonical Integrals ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles") ) are used.) For details, see Connor and Curtis ([1982](./bib/C.html#bib570 "A method for the numerical evaluation of the oscillatory integrals associated with the cuspoid catastrophes: Application to Pearcey’s integral and its derivatives")) and Kirk et al. ([2000](./bib/K.html#bib1277 "An adaptive contour code for the numerical evaluation of the oscillatory cuspoid canonical integrals and their derivatives")). There is considerable freedom in the choice of deformations.


## §36.15(iv) Integration along Finite Contour

This can be carried out by direct numerical evaluation of canonical integrals along a finite segment of the real axis including all real critical points of $\Phi$ , with contributions from the contour outside this range approximated by the first terms of an asymptotic series associated with the endpoints. See Berry et al. ([1979](./bib/B.html#bib266 "The elliptic umbilic diffraction catastrophe")).
