The methods used for computing the Coulomb functions described below are similar to those in § [13.29](./13.29.md "§13.29 Methods of Computation ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") .

The power-series expansions of §§ [33.6](./33.6.md "§33.6 Power-Series Expansions in 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") and [33.19](./33.19.md "§33.19 Power-Series Expansions in 𝑟 ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") converge for all finite values of the radii $\rho$ and $r$ , respectively, and may be used to compute the regular and irregular solutions. Cancellation errors increase with increases in $\rho$ and $|r|$ , and may be estimated by comparing the final sum of the series with the largest partial sum. Use of extended-precision arithmetic increases the radial range that yields accurate results, but eventually other methods must be employed, for example, the asymptotic expansions of §§ [33.11](./33.11.md "§33.11 Asymptotic Expansions for Large 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") and [33.21](./33.21.md "§33.21 Asymptotic Approximations for Large |𝑟| ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") .


## §33.23(iii) Integration of Defining Differential Equations

:::{note}
**Notes:**

Stable integration directions for the differential equations are determined by comparison of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the radii tend to infinity and also as the radii tend to zero (§§ [33.11](./33.11.md "§33.11 Asymptotic Expansions for Large 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") , [33.21](./33.21.md "§33.21 Asymptotic Approximations for Large |𝑟| ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") ; §§ [33.6](./33.6.md "§33.6 Power-Series Expansions in 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") , [33.19](./33.19.md "§33.19 Power-Series Expansions in 𝑟 ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") ).

When numerical values of the Coulomb functions are available for some radii, their values for other radii may be obtained by direct numerical integration of equations ( 33.2.1 ) or ( 33.14.1 ), provided that the integration is carried out in a stable direction (§ [3.7](./3.7.md "§3.7 Ordinary Differential Equations ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ). Thus the regular solutions can be computed from the power-series expansions (§§ [33.6](./33.6.md "§33.6 Power-Series Expansions in 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") , [33.19](./33.19.md "§33.19 Power-Series Expansions in 𝑟 ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") ) for small values of the radii and then integrated in the direction of increasing values of the radii. On the other hand, the irregular solutions of §§ 33.2(iii) and 33.14(iii) need to be integrated in the direction of decreasing radii beginning, for example, with values obtained from asymptotic expansions (§§ [33.11](./33.11.md "§33.11 Asymptotic Expansions for Large 𝜌 ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") and [33.21](./33.21.md "§33.21 Asymptotic Approximations for Large |𝑟| ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") ).


## §33.23(iv) Recurrence Relations

:::{note}
**Notes:**

Stable recurrence directions for § [33.4](./33.4.md "§33.4 Recurrence Relations and Derivatives ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") are determined by the asymptotic form of $F_{\ell}\left(\eta,\rho\right)/G_{\ell}\left(\eta,\rho\right)$ as $\ell\to\infty$ ; see ( 33.5.8 ) and ( 33.5.9 ). For § [33.17](./33.17.md "§33.17 Recurrence Relations and Derivatives ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") see § [33.18](./33.18.md "§33.18 Limiting Forms for Large ℓ ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") .

In a similar manner to § 33.23(iii) the recurrence relations of §§ [33.4](./33.4.md "§33.4 Recurrence Relations and Derivatives ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") or [33.17](./33.17.md "§33.17 Recurrence Relations and Derivatives ‣ Variables 𝑟,ϵ ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") can be used for a range of values of the integer $\ell$ , provided that the recurrence is carried out in a stable direction (§ [3.6](./3.6.md "§3.6 Linear Difference Equations ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ). This implies decreasing $\ell$ for the regular solutions and increasing $\ell$ for the irregular solutions of §§ 33.2(iii) and 33.14(iii) .

§ [33.8](./33.8.md "§33.8 Continued Fractions ‣ Variables 𝜌,𝜂 ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") supplies continued fractions for $F_{\ell}'/F_{\ell}$ and ${H^{\pm}_{\ell}}'/{H^{\pm}_{\ell}}$ . Combined with the Wronskians ( 33.2.12 ), the values of $F_{\ell}$ , $G_{\ell}$ , and their derivatives can be extracted. Inside the turning points, that is, when $\rho<\rho_{\operatorname{tp}}\left(\eta,\ell\right)$ , there can be a loss of precision by a factor of approximately $|G_{\ell}|^{2}$ .

Curtis ([1964a](./bib/C.html#bib605 "Coulomb Wave Functions"), §10) describes the use of series, radial integration, and other methods to generate the tables listed in § [33.24](./33.24.md "§33.24 Tables ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 33 Coulomb Functions") .

Bardin et al. ([1972](./bib/B.html#bib191 "Coulomb functions in entire ( η , ρ )-plane")) describes ten different methods for the calculation of $F_{\ell}$ and $G_{\ell}$ , valid in different regions of the ( $\eta,\rho$ )-plane.

Thompson and Barnett ([1985](./bib/T.html#bib2243 "COULCC: A continued-fraction algorithm for Coulomb functions of complex order with complex arguments"), [1986](./bib/T.html#bib2244 "Coulomb and Bessel functions of complex arguments and order")) and Thompson ([2004](./bib/T.html#bib2242 "Erratum to “COULCC: A continued-fraction algorithm for Coulomb functions of complex order with complex arguments”")) use combinations of series, continued fractions, and Padé-accelerated asymptotic expansions (§ 3.11(iv) ) for the analytic continuations of Coulomb functions.

Noble ([2004](./bib/N.html#bib1726 "Evaluation of negative energy Coulomb (Whittaker) functions")) obtains double-precision accuracy for $W_{-\eta,\mu}\left(2\rho\right)$ for a wide range of parameters using a combination of recurrence techniques, power-series expansions, and numerical quadrature; compare ( 33.2.7 ).

WKBJ approximations (§ 2.7(iii) ) for $\rho>\rho_{\operatorname{tp}}\left(\eta,\ell\right)$ are presented in Hull and Breit ([1959](./bib/H.html#bib1110 "Coulomb Wave Functions")) and [Seaton and Peach](./bib/S.html#bib2037 "The determination of phases of wave functions") ([1962](./bib/S.html#bib2037 "The determination of phases of wave functions"): in Eq. (12) $(\rho-c)/c$ should be $(\rho-c)/\rho$ ). A set of consistent second-order WKBJ formulas is given by [Burgess](./bib/B.html#bib383 "The determination of phases and amplitudes of wave functions") ([1963](./bib/B.html#bib383 "The determination of phases and amplitudes of wave functions"): in Eq. (16) $3\kappa^{2}+2$ should be $3\kappa^{2}c+2$ ). Seaton ([1984](./bib/S.html#bib2033 "The accuracy of iterated JWBK approximations for Coulomb radial functions")) estimates the accuracies of these approximations.

Hull and Breit ([1959](./bib/H.html#bib1110 "Coulomb Wave Functions")) and Barnett ([1981b](./bib/B.html#bib198 "KLEIN: Coulomb functions for real λ and positive energy to high accuracy")) give WKBJ approximations for $F_{0}$ and $G_{0}$ in the region inside the turning point: $\rho<\rho_{\operatorname{tp}}\left(\eta,\ell\right)$ .
