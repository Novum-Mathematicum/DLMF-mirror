# Chapter 36 Integrals with Coalescing Saddles

:::{note}
**Notes:**

There is no single source covering the material in this chapter. An overview of some of the mathematical analysis is given in Arnol’d ([1975](./bib/index.html#bib135 "Critical points of smooth functions, and their normal forms"), [1986](./bib/index.html#bib136 "Catastrophe Theory")). Many physical applications can be found in Poston and Stewart ([1978](./bib/P.html#bib1895 "Catastrophe Theory and its Applications")). For applications to wave physics, especially optics, see Berry and Upstill ([1980](./bib/B.html#bib267 "Catastrophe optics: Morphologies of caustics and their diffraction patterns")).
