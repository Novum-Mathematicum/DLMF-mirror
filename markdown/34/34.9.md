The graphical method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between an analytic expression and a diagram by assigning a graphical symbol to each function and operation of the analytic expression. Thus, any analytic expression in the theory, for example equations ( 34.3.16 ), ( 34.4.1 ), ( 34.5.15 ), and ( 34.7.3 ), may be represented by a diagram; conversely, any diagram represents an analytic equation. For an account of this method see Brink and Satchler ([1993](./bib/B.html#bib355 "Angular Momentum"), Chapter VII). For specific examples of the graphical method of representing sums involving the $\mathit{3j},\mathit{6j}$ , and $\mathit{9j}$ symbols, see Varshalovich et al. ([1988](./bib/V.html#bib2323 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum"), Chapters 11, 12) and Lehman and O’Connell ([1973](./bib/L.html#bib1403 "Graphical Recoupling of Angular Momenta"), §3.3).
