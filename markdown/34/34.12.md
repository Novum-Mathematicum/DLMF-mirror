The angular momentum coupling coefficients ( $\mathit{3j}$ , $\mathit{6j}$ , and $\mathit{9j}$ symbols) are essential in the fields of nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics. For applications in nuclear structure, see de-Shalit and Talmi ([1963](./bib/D.html#bib651 "Nuclear Shell Theory")); in atomic spectroscopy, see Biedenharn and van Dam ([1965](./bib/B.html#bib279 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum. A Collection of Reprints and Original Papers"), pp. 134–200), Judd ([1998](./bib/J.html#bib1197 "Operator Techniques in Atomic Spectroscopy")), Sobelman ([1992](./bib/S.html#bib2133 "Atomic Spectra and Radiative Transitions"), Chapter 4), Shore and Menzel ([1968](./bib/S.html#bib2073 "Principles of Atomic Spectra"), pp. 268–303), and Wigner ([1959](./bib/W.html#bib2409 "Group Theory and its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra")); in molecular spectroscopy and chemical reactions, see Burshtein and Temkin ([1994](./bib/B.html#bib387 "Spectroscopy of Molecular Rotation in Gases and Liquids"), Chapter 5), and Judd ([1975](./bib/J.html#bib1196 "Angular Momentum Theory for Diatomic Molecules")). $\mathit{3j},\mathit{6j}$ , and $\mathit{9j}$ symbols are also found in multipole expansions of solutions of the Laplace and Helmholtz equations; see Carlson and Rushbrooke ([1950](./bib/C.html#bib2623 "On the expansion of a Coulomb potential in spherical harmonics")) and Judd ([1976](./bib/J.html#bib2624 "Modifications of Coulombic interactions by polarizable atoms")).
