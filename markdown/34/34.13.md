Methods of computation for $\mathit{3j}$ and $\mathit{6j}$ symbols include recursion relations, see Schulten and Gordon ([1975a](./bib/S.html#bib2024 "Exact recursive evaluation of ⁢ 3 j - and ⁢ 6 j -coefficients for quantum-mechanical coupling of angular momenta")), Luscombe and Luban ([1998](./bib/L.html#bib1505 "Simplified recursive algorithm for Wigner ⁢ 3 j and ⁢ 6 j symbols")), and Edmonds ([1974](./bib/E.html#bib727 "Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics"), pp. 42–45, 48–51, 97–99); summation of single-sum expressions for these symbols, see Varshalovich et al. ([1988](./bib/V.html#bib2323 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum"), §§8.2.6, 9.2.1) and Fang and Shriner ([1992](./bib/F.html#bib774 "A computer program for the calculation of angular-momentum coupling coefficients")); evaluation of the generalized hypergeometric functions of unit argument that represent these symbols, see Srinivasa Rao and Venkatesh ([1978](./bib/S.html#bib2150 "New Fortran programs for angular momentum coefficients")) and Srinivasa Rao ([1981](./bib/S.html#bib2147 "Computation of angular momentum coefficients using sets of generalized hypergeometric functions")).

For $\mathit{9j}$ symbols, methods include evaluation of the single-sum series ( 34.6.2 ), see Fang and Shriner ([1992](./bib/F.html#bib774 "A computer program for the calculation of angular-momentum coupling coefficients")); evaluation of triple-sum series, see Varshalovich et al. ([1988](./bib/V.html#bib2323 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum"), §10.2.1) and Srinivasa Rao et al. ([1989](./bib/S.html#bib2149 "A new Fortran program for the 9 - j angular momentum coefficient")). A review of methods of computation is given in Srinivasa Rao and Rajeswari ([1993](./bib/S.html#bib2148 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum: Selected Topics"), Chapter VII, pp. 235–265). See also Roothaan and Lai ([1997](./bib/R.html#bib1966 "Calculation of ⁢ 3 n - j symbols by Labarthe’s method")) and references given there.
