An English translation of Pólya ([1937](./bib/P.html#bib1889 "Kombinatorische Anzahlbestimmungen für Gruppen, Graphen und chemische Verbindungen")) on applications of combinatorics to chemistry has been published as Pólya and Read ([1987](./bib/P.html#bib1890 "Combinatorial Enumeration of Groups, Graphs, and Chemical Compounds")). Other articles on this subject are de Bruijn ([1981](./bib/D.html#bib627 "Pólya’s Theory of Counting")) and Rouvray ([1995](./bib/R.html#bib1979 "Combinatorics in Chemistry")). The latter reference also describes chemical applications of other combinatorial techniques.

Applications of combinatorics, especially integer and plane partitions, to counting lattice structures and other problems of statistical mechanics, of which the Ising model is the principal example, can be found in Montroll ([1964](./bib/M.html#bib1646 "Lattice Statistics")), Godsil et al. ([1995](./bib/G.html#bib946 "Combinatorics in Statistical Physics")), Baxter ([1982](./bib/B.html#bib221 "Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics")), and Korepin et al. ([1993](./bib/K.html#bib1334 "Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and Correlation Functions")). For an application of statistical mechanics to combinatorics, see Bressoud ([1999](./bib/B.html#bib348 "Proofs and Confirmations: The Story of the Alternating Sign Matrix Conjecture")).

Other applications to problems in engineering, crystallography, biology, and computer science can be found in Beckenbach ([1981](./bib/B.html#bib225 "Applied Combinatorial Mathematics")) and Graham et al. ([1995](./bib/G.html#bib973 "Handbook of Combinatorics. Vols. 1, 2")).
