Annotations for Ch.4
:::

The *Einstein functions* and *Planck’s radiation function* are elementary combinations of exponentials, or exponentials and logarithms. See Abramowitz and Stegun ([1964](./bib/index.html#bib24 "Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables"), pp. 999–1000) and Ashcroft and Mermin ([1976](./bib/index.html#bib2748 "Solid State Physics"), Chapter 23).

For applications of generalized exponentials and generalized logarithms to computer arithmetic see § 3.1(iv) .

For an application of the Lambert $W$ -function to generalized Gaussian noise see Chapeau-Blondeau and Monir ([2002](./bib/C.html#bib464 "Numerical evaluation of the Lambert W function and application to generation of generalized Gaussian noise with exponent 1/2")). For other applications of the Lambert $W$ -function see Corless et al. ([1996](./bib/C.html#bib585 "On the Lambert W function")).
