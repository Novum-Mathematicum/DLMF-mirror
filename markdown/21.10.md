In addition to evaluating the Fourier series, the main problem here is to compute a Riemann matrix originating from a Riemann surface. Various approaches are considered in the following references:

* Belokolos et al. ([1994](./bib/B.html#bib232 "Algebro-geometric Approach to Nonlinear Integrable Problems"), Chapter 5) and references therein. Here the Riemann surface is represented by the action of a Schottky group on a region of the complex plane. The same representation is used in Gianni et al. ([1998](./bib/G.html#bib912 "Riemann surfaces, plane algebraic curves and their period matrices")).
* Tretkoff and Tretkoff ([1984](./bib/T.html#bib2272 "Combinatorial Group Theory, Riemann Surfaces and Differential Equations")). Here a Hurwitz system is chosen to represent the Riemann surface.
* Deconinck and van Hoeij ([2001](./bib/D.html#bib635 "Computing Riemann matrices of algebraic curves")). Here a plane algebraic curve representation of the Riemann surface is used.
