The functions $P\left(a,x\right)$ and $Q\left(a,x\right)$ are used extensively in statistics as the probability integrals of the gamma distribution; see Johnson et al. ([1994](./bib/J.html#bib1175 "Continuous Univariate Distributions"), pp. 337–414). Particular forms are the chi-square distribution functions; see Johnson et al. ([1994](./bib/J.html#bib1175 "Continuous Univariate Distributions"), pp. 415–493). The function $\mathrm{B}_{x}\left(a,b\right)$ and its normalization $I_{x}\left(a,b\right)$ play a similar role in statistics in connection with the beta distribution; see Johnson et al. ([1995](./bib/J.html#bib1176 "Continuous Univariate Distributions"), pp. 210–275). In queueing theory the Erlang loss function is used, which can be expressed in terms of the reciprocal of $Q\left(a,x\right)$ ; see Jagerman ([1974](./bib/J.html#bib2563 "Some properties of the Erlang loss function")) and Cooper ([1981](./bib/C.html#bib2564 "Introduction to Queueing Theory"), pp. 80, 316–319).
