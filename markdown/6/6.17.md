Annotations for Ch.6
:::

Geller and Ng ([1969](./bib/G.html#bib902 "A table of integrals of the exponential integral")) cites work with applications from diffusion theory, transport problems, the study of the radiative equilibrium of stellar atmospheres, and the evaluation of exchange integrals occurring in quantum mechanics. For applications in astrophysics, see also van de Hulst ([1980](./bib/V.html#bib2309 "Multiple Light Scattering")). Lebedev ([1965](./bib/L.html#bib1394 "Special Functions and Their Applications")) gives an application to electromagnetic theory (radiation of a linear half-wave oscillator), in which sine and cosine integrals are used.
