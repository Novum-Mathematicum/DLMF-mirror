**Notes:**

See Temme ([1996b](./bib/T.html#bib2230 "Special Functions: An Introduction to the Classical Functions of Mathematical Physics"), pp. 181–182: the numerical value 1.089490⁢… on p. 182 should be replaced by 1.1789⁢…). Gibbs reported this phenomenon in a letter to Nature , 59 (1899, p. 606). Figure 6.16.1 was produced at NIST.

Consider the Fourier series


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
\sin x+\tfrac{1}{3}\sin\left(3x\right)+\tfrac{1}{5}\sin\left(5x\right)+\dots=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{4}\pi,&0<x<\pi,\\
0,&x=0,\\
-\frac{1}{4}\pi,&-\pi<x<0.\end{cases} \tag{6.16.1}
$$

The $n$ th partial sum is given by


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
S_{n}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\sin\left((2k+1)x\right)}{2k+1}=\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{\sin\left(2nt\right)}{\sin t}\,\mathrm{d}t=\tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{Si}\left(2nx\right)+R_{n}(x), \tag{6.16.2}
$$

where


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
R_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{x}\left(\frac{1}{\sin t}-\frac{1}{t}\right)\sin\left(2nt\right)\,\mathrm{d}t. \tag{6.16.3}
$$

By integration by parts


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
R_{n}(x)=O\left(n^{-1}\right), \tag{6.16.4}
$$

uniformly for $x\in[-\pi,\pi]$ . Hence, if $x$ is fixed and $n\to\infty$ , then $S_{n}(x)\to\frac{1}{4}\pi$ , $0$ , or $-\frac{1}{4}\pi$ according as $0<x<\pi$ , $x=0$ , or $-\pi<x<0$ ; compare ( 6.2.14 ).

These limits are not approached uniformly, however. The first maximum of $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Si}\left(x\right)$ for positive $x$ occurs at $x=\pi$ and equals $(1.1789\dots)\times\frac{1}{4}\pi$ ; compare Figure 6.3.2 . Hence if $x=\pi/(2n)$ and $n\to\infty$ , then the limiting value of $S_{n}(x)$ overshoots $\frac{1}{4}\pi$ by approximately 18%. Similarly if $x=\pi/n$ , then the limiting value of $S_{n}(x)$ undershoots $\frac{1}{4}\pi$ by approximately 10%, and so on. Compare Figure 6.16.1 .

This nonuniformity of convergence is an illustration of the *Gibbs phenomenon* . It occurs with Fourier-series expansions of all piecewise continuous functions. See Carslaw ([1930](./bib/C.html#bib456 "Introduction to the Theory of Fourier’s Series and Integrals")) for additional graphs and information.

If we assume Riemann’s hypothesis that all nonreal zeros of $\zeta\left(s\right)$ have real part of $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (§ 25.10(i) ), then


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
\operatorname{li}\left(x\right)-\pi(x)=O\left(\sqrt{x}\ln x\right), \tag{6.16.5}
$$

where $\pi(x)$ is the number of primes less than or equal to $x$ . Compare § [27.12](./27.12.md "§27.12 Asymptotic Formulas: Primes ‣ Multiplicative Number Theory ‣ Chapter 27 Functions of Number Theory") and Figure 6.16.2 .
