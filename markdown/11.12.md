Applications of Struve functions occur in water-wave and surface-wave problems (Hirata ([1975](./bib/H.html#bib1087 "Flow near the bow of a steadily turning ship")) and Ahmadi and Widnall ([1985](./bib/index.html#bib41 "Unsteady lifting-line theory as a singular-perturbation problem"))), unsteady aerodynamics (Shaw ([1985](./bib/S.html#bib2060 "Perturbational results for diffraction of water-waves by nearly-vertical barriers")) and Wehausen and Laitone ([1960](./bib/W.html#bib2384 "Surface Waves"))), distribution of fluid pressure over a vibrating disk (McLachlan ([1934](./bib/M.html#bib1584 "Loud Speakers: Theory, Performance, Testing and Design"))), resistive MHD instability theory (Paris and Sy ([1983](./bib/P.html#bib1846 "Influence of equilibrium shear flow along the magnetic field on the resistive tearing instability"))), and optical diffraction (Levine and Schwinger ([1948](./bib/L.html#bib2639 "On the theory of diffraction by an aperture in an infinite plane screen. I"))). More recently Struve functions have appeared in many particle quantum dynamical studies of spin decoherence (Shao and Hänggi ([1998](./bib/S.html#bib2642 "Decoherent dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a sea of spins"))) and nanotubes (Pedersen ([2003](./bib/P.html#bib2641 "Variational approach to excitons in carbon nanotubes"))).
