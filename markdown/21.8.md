Annotations for Ch.21
:::

An Abelian function is a $2g$ -fold periodic, meromorphic function of $g$ complex variables. In consequence, Abelian functions are generalizations of elliptic functions (§ 23.2(iii) ) to more than one complex variable. For every Abelian function, there is a positive integer $n$ , such that the Abelian function can be expressed as a ratio of linear combinations of products with $n$ factors of Riemann theta functions with characteristics that share a common period lattice. For further information see Igusa ([1972](./bib/I.html#bib1121 "Theta Functions"), pp. 132–135) and Markushevich ([1992](./bib/M.html#bib1552 "Introduction to the Classical Theory of Abelian Functions")).
