Simply-periodic Lamé functions ( $\nu$ noninteger) can be used to solve boundary-value problems for Laplace’s equation in elliptical cones. For applications in antenna research see Jansen ([1977](./bib/J.html#bib1162 "Simple-periodic and Non-periodic Lamé Functions")). Brack et al. ([2001](./bib/B.html#bib341 "Occurrence of periodic Lamé functions at bifurcations in chaotic Hamiltonian systems")) shows that Lamé functions occur at bifurcations in chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Bronski et al. ([2001](./bib/B.html#bib357 "Stability of repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates in a periodic potential")) uses Lamé functions in the theory of Bose–Einstein condensates.
