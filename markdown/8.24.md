The function $E_{p}\left(x\right)$ , with $p>0$ , appears in theories of transport and radiative equilibrium (Hopf ([1934](./bib/H.html#bib1096 "Mathematical Problems of Radiative Equilibrium")), Kourganoff ([1952](./bib/K.html#bib1338 "Basic Methods in Transfer Problems. Radiative Equilibrium and Neutron Diffusion")), Altaç ([1996](./bib/index.html#bib2657 "Integrals involving Bickley and Bessel functions in radiative transfer, and generalized exponential integral functions"))).

With more general values of $p$ , $E_{p}\left(x\right)$ supplies fundamental auxiliary functions that are used in the computation of molecular electronic integrals in quantum chemistry (Harris ([2002](./bib/H.html#bib2613 "Analytic evaluation of two-center STO electron repulsion integrals via ellipsoidal expansion")), Shavitt ([1963](./bib/S.html#bib2621 "The Gaussian Function in Calculations of Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics"))), and also wave acoustics of overlapping sound beams (Ding ([2000](./bib/D.html#bib2620 "A simplified algorithm for the second-order sound fields"))).
