Annotations for Ch.12
:::

Because PCFs are special cases of confluent hypergeometric functions, the methods of computation described in § [13.29](./13.29.md "§13.29 Methods of Computation ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") are applicable to PCFs. These include the use of power-series expansions, recursion, integral representations, differential equations, asymptotic expansions, and expansions in series of Bessel functions. See, especially, Temme ([2000](./bib/T.html#bib2233 "Numerical and asymptotic aspects of parabolic cylinder functions")) and Gil et al. ([2004c](./bib/G.html#bib931 "Integral representations for computing real parabolic cylinder functions"), [2006a](./bib/G.html#bib933 "Computing the real parabolic cylinder functions ⁢ U ( a , x ) , ⁢ V ( a , x )"), [2006b](./bib/G.html#bib934 "Algorithm 850: Real parabolic cylinder functions ⁢ U ( a , x ) , ⁢ V ( a , x )"), [2011a](./bib/G.html#bib2794 "Algorithm 914: parabolic cylinder function ⁢ W ( a , x ) and its derivative"), [2011b](./bib/G.html#bib2815 "Fast and accurate computation of the Weber parabolic cylinder function ⁢ W ( a , x )")).
