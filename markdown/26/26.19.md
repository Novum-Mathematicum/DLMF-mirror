Annotations for Ch.26

Combinatorics has applications to analysis, algebra, and geometry. Examples can be found in Beckenbach ([1981](./bib/B.html#bib225 "Applied Combinatorial Mathematics")), Billera et al. ([1996](./bib/B.html#bib284 "Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics")), and Lovász et al. ([1995](./bib/L.html#bib1471 "Combinatorics in Pure Mathematics")). Partitions and plane partitions have applications to representation theory (Bressoud ([1999](./bib/B.html#bib348 "Proofs and Confirmations: The Story of the Alternating Sign Matrix Conjecture")), Macdonald ([1995](./bib/M.html#bib1518 "Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials")), and Sagan ([2001](./bib/S.html#bib1989 "The Symmetric Group: Representations, Combinatorial Algorithms, and Symmetric Functions"))) and to special functions (Andrews et al. ([1999](./bib/index.html#bib103 "Special Functions")) and Gasper and Rahman ([2004](./bib/G.html#bib862 "Basic Hypergeometric Series"))).

Other areas of combinatorial analysis include graph theory, coding theory, and combinatorial designs. These have applications in operations research, probability theory, and statistics. See Graham et al. ([1995](./bib/G.html#bib973 "Handbook of Combinatorics. Vols. 1, 2")) and Rosen et al. ([2000](./bib/R.html#bib1970 "Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics")).
