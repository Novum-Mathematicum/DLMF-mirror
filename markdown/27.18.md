An overview of methods for precise counting of the number of primes not exceeding an arbitrary integer $x$ is given in Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §3.7). T. Oliveira e Silva has calculated $\pi\left(x\right)$ for $x=10^{23}$ , using the combinatorial methods of Lagarias et al. ([1985](./bib/L.html#bib1367 "Computing ⁢ π ( x ) : The Meissel-Lehmer method")) and Deléglise and Rivat ([1996](./bib/D.html#bib644 "Computing ⁢ π ( x ) : The Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko method")); see Oliveira e Silva ([2006](./bib/O.html#bib2733 "Computing ⁢ π ( x ) : The combinatorial method")). An analytic approach using a contour integral of the Riemann zeta function (§ 25.2(i) ) is discussed in Borwein et al. ([2000](./bib/B.html#bib317 "Computational strategies for the Riemann zeta function")).

The *Sieve of Eratosthenes* (Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §3.2)) generates a list of all primes below a given bound. An alternative procedure is the *binary quadratic sieve* of Atkin and Bernstein (Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), p. 170)).

For small values of $n$ , primality is proven by showing that $n$ is not divisible by any prime not exceeding $\sqrt{n}$ .

Two simple algorithms for proving primality require a knowledge of all or part of the factorization of $n-1,n+1$ , or both; see Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §§4.1–4.2). These algorithms are used for testing primality of *Mersenne numbers* , $2^{n}-1$ , and *Fermat numbers* , $2^{2^{n}}+1$ .

The *APR (Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely)* algorithm for primality testing is based on Jacobi sums. It runs in time $O\left((\ln n)^{c\ln\ln\ln n}\right)$ . Explanations are given in Cohen ([1993](./bib/C.html#bib555 "A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory"), §9.1) and Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §4.4). A practical version is described in Bosma and van der Hulst ([1990](./bib/B.html#bib321 "Faster Primality Testing")).

The *AKS (Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena)* algorithm is the first deterministic, polynomial-time, primality test. That is to say, it runs in time $O\left((\ln n)^{c}\right)$ for some constant $c$ . An explanation is given in Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §4.5).

The *ECPP (Elliptic Curve Primality Proving)* algorithm handles primes with over 20,000 digits. Explanations are given in Cohen ([1993](./bib/C.html#bib555 "A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory"), §9.2) and Crandall and Pomerance ([2005](./bib/C.html#bib596 "Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective"), §7.6).
