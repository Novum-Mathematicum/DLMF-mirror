The *elementary trapezoidal rule* is given by


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\tfrac{1}{2}h(f(a)+f(b))-\tfrac{1}{12}h^{3}f^{\prime\prime}(\xi), \tag{3.5.1}
$$

where $h=b-a$ , $f\in C^{2}[a,b]$ , and $a<\xi<b$ .

The *composite trapezoidal rule* is


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=h(\tfrac{1}{2}f_{0}+f_{1}+\dots+f_{n-1}+\tfrac{1}{2}f_{n})+E_{n}(f), \tag{3.5.2}
$$

where $h=(b-a)/n$ , $x_{k}=a+kh$ , $f_{k}=f(x_{k})$ , $k=0,1,\dots,n$ , and


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
E_{n}(f)=-\frac{b-a}{12}h^{2}f^{\prime\prime}(\xi), \tag{3.5.3}
$$

If in addition $f$ is periodic, $f\in C^{k}(\mathbb{R})$ , and the integral is taken over a period, then


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
E_{n}(f)=O\left(h^{k}\right), \tag{3.5.4}
$$

In particular, when $k=\infty$ the error term is an exponentially-small function of $1/h$ , and in these circumstances the composite trapezoidal rule is exceptionally efficient. For an example see § 3.5(ix) .

Similar results hold for the trapezoidal rule in the form


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=h\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}f(kh)+E_{h}(f), \tag{3.5.5}
$$

with a function $f$ that is analytic in a strip containing $\mathbb{R}$ . For further information and examples, see Goodwin ([1949b](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/G#bib956 "The evaluation of integrals of the form ∫ ∞ - ∞ ⁢ f ( x ) e - x 2 d x")). In Stenger ([1993](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/S#bib2171 "Numerical Methods Based on Sinc and Analytic Functions"), Chapter 3) the rule ( 3.5.5 ) is considered in the framework of Sinc approximations (§ [3.3(vi)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/3.3#vi "§3.3(vi) Other Interpolation Methods ‣ §3.3 Interpolation ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ). See also Poisson’s summation formula (§ [1.8(iv)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.8#iv "§1.8(iv) Poisson’s Summation Formula ‣ §1.8 Fourier Series ‣ Topics of Discussion ‣ Chapter 1 Algebraic and Analytic Methods") ).

If $k$ in ( 3.5.4 ) is not arbitrarily large, and if odd-order derivatives of $f$ are known at the end points $a$ and $b$ , then the composite trapezoidal rule can be improved by means of the Euler–Maclaurin formula (§ [2.10(i)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/2.10#i "§2.10(i) Euler–Maclaurin Formula ‣ §2.10 Sums and Sequences ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 2 Asymptotic Approximations") ).

Let $h=\frac{1}{2}(b-a)$ and $f\in C^{4}[a,b]$ . Then the *elementary Simpson’s rule* is


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\tfrac{1}{3}h(f(a)+4f(\tfrac{1}{2}(a+b))+f(b))-\tfrac{1}{90}h^{5}f^{(4)}(\xi), \tag{3.5.6}
$$

where $a<\xi<b$ .

Now let $h=(b-a)/n$ , $x_{k}=a+kh$ , and $f_{k}=f(x_{k})$ , $k=0,1,\dots,n$ . Then the *composite Simpson’s rule* is


<a id="E7"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\tfrac{1}{3}h(f_{0}+4f_{1}+2f_{2}+4f_{3}+2f_{4}+\cdots+4f_{n-1}+f_{n})+E_{n}(f), \tag{3.5.7}
$$

where $n$ is even and


<a id="E8"></a>
$$
E_{n}(f)=-\frac{b-a}{180}h^{4}f^{(4)}(\xi), \tag{3.5.8}
$$

Simpson’s rule can be regarded as a combination of two trapezoidal rules, one with step size $h$ and one with step size $h/2$ to refine the error term.

Further refinements are achieved by *Romberg integration* . If $f\in C^{2m+2}[a,b]$ , then the remainder $E_{n}(f)$ in ( 3.5.2 ) can be expanded in the form


<a id="E9"></a>
$$
E_{n}(f)=c_{1}h^{2}+c_{2}h^{4}+\dots+c_{m}h^{2m}+O\left(h^{2m+2}\right), \tag{3.5.9}
$$

where $h=(b-a)/n$ . As in Simpson’s rule, by combining the rule for $h$ with that for $h/2$ , the first error term $c_{1}h^{2}$ in ( 3.5.9 ) can be eliminated. With the Romberg scheme successive terms $c_{1}h^{2},c_{2}h^{4},\dots$ , in ( 3.5.9 ) are eliminated, according to the formula


<a id="E10"></a>
$$
G_{k}(\tfrac{1}{2}h)=G_{k-1}(\tfrac{1}{2}h)+\frac{G_{k-1}(\frac{1}{2}h)-G_{k-1}(h)}{4^{k}-1}, \tag{3.5.10}
$$

beginning with


<a id="E11"></a>
$$
G_{0}(h)=h(\tfrac{1}{2}f_{0}+f_{1}+\dots+f_{n-1}+\tfrac{1}{2}f_{n}), \tag{3.5.11}
$$

although we may also start with the elementary rule with $G_{0}(h)=\frac{1}{2}h(f(a)+f(b))$ and $h=b-a$ . To generate $G_{k}(h)$ the quantities $G_{0}(h),G_{0}(h/2),\dots,G_{0}(h/2^{k})$ are needed. These can be found by means of the recursion


<a id="E12"></a>
$$
G_{0}(\tfrac{1}{2}h)=\tfrac{1}{2}G_{0}(h)+\tfrac{1}{2}h\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f\left(x_{0}+(k+\tfrac{1}{2})h\right), \tag{3.5.12}
$$

which depends on function values computed previously.

If $f\in C^{2k+2}(a,b)$ , then for $j,k=0,1,\dots$ ,


<a id="E13"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x-G_{k}\left(\frac{b-a}{2^{j}}\right)=-\frac{(b-a)^{2k+3}}{2^{k(k+1)}}\frac{4^{-j(k+1)}}{(2k+2)!}\left|B_{2k+2}\right|f^{(2k+2)}(\xi), \tag{3.5.13}
$$

for some $\xi\in(a,b)$ . For the Bernoulli numbers $B_{m}$ see § [24.2(i)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/24.2#i "§24.2(i) Bernoulli Numbers and Polynomials ‣ §24.2 Definitions and Generating Functions ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 24 Bernoulli and Euler Polynomials") .

When $f\in C^{\infty}$ , the Romberg method affords a means of obtaining high accuracy in many cases with a relatively simple adaptive algorithm. However, as illustrated by the next example, other methods may be more efficient.

is computed with $p=1$ on the interval $[0,30]$ . Using ( 3.5.10 ) with $h=30/4=7.5$ we obtain $G_{7}(h)$ with 14 correct digits. About $2^{9}=512$ function evaluations are needed. (With the 20-point Gauss–Laguerre formula (§ 3.5(v) ) the same precision can be achieved with 15 function evaluations.) With $j=2$ and $k=7$ , the coefficient of the derivative $f^{(16)}(\xi)$ in ( 3.5.13 ) is found to be $(0.14\dots)\times 10^{-13}$ .

An *interpolatory quadrature rule*


<a id="E15"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}f(x_{k})+E_{n}(f), \tag{3.5.15}
$$

with *weight function* $w(x)$ , is one for which $E_{n}(f)=0$ whenever $f$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq n-1$ . The *nodes* $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}$ are prescribed, and the *weights* $w_{k}$ and *error term* $E_{n}(f)$ are found by integrating the product of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of degree $n-1$ and $w(x)$ .

If the extreme members of the set of nodes $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}$ are the endpoints $a$ and $b$ , then the quadrature rule is said to be *closed* . Or if the set $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}$ lies in the open interval $(a,b)$ , then the quadrature rule is said to be *open* .

Rules of closed type include the *Newton–Cotes formulas* such as the trapezoidal rules and *Simpson’s rule* . Examples of open rules are the Gauss formulas (§ 3.5(v) ), the *midpoint rule* , and *Fejér’s quadrature rule* . For the latter $a=-1$ , $b=1$ , and the nodes $x_{k}$ are the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_{n}\left(x\right)$ (§ [3.11(ii)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/3.11#ii "§3.11(ii) Chebyshev-Series Expansions ‣ §3.11 Approximation Techniques ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") and § [18.3](https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.3 "§18.3 Definitions ‣ Classical Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") ). If we add $-1$ and $1$ to this set of $x_{k}$ , then the resulting closed formula is the frequently-used *Clenshaw–Curtis formula* , whose weights are positive and given by


<a id="E16"></a>
$$
w_{k}=\frac{g_{k}}{n}\left(1-\sum_{j=1}^{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor}\frac{b_{j}}{4j^{2}-1}\cos\left(2jk\pi/n\right)\right), \tag{3.5.16}
$$

where $x_{k}=\cos\left(k\pi/n\right),k=0,1,\ldots,n$ , and


<a id="E17"></a>
$$
g_{k}=\begin{cases}1,&\text{$k=0,n$},\\
2,&\text{otherwise},\end{cases}\quad b_{j}=\begin{cases}1,&\text{$j=\frac{1}{2}n$},\\
2,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases} \tag{3.5.17}
$$

Let $\{p_{n}\}$ denote the set of monic polynomials $p_{n}$ of degree $n$ (coefficient of $x^{n}$ equal to $1$ ) that are orthogonal with respect to a positive weight function $w$ on a finite or infinite interval $(a,b)$ ; compare § [18.2(i)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.2#i "§18.2(i) Definition ‣ §18.2 General Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ General Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") . In *Gauss quadrature* (also known as *Gauss–Christoffel quadrature* ) we use ( 3.5.15 ) with nodes $x_{k}$ the zeros of $p_{n}$ , and weights $w_{k}$ given by


<a id="E18"></a>
$$
w_{k}=\int_{a}^{b}\frac{p_{n}(x)}{(x-x_{k})p^{\mspace{1.0mu}\prime}_{n}(x_{k})}\,w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x. \tag{3.5.18}
$$

The $w_{k}$ are also known as *Christoffel coefficients* or *Christoffel numbers* and they are all positive. The remainder is given by


<a id="E19"></a>
$$
E_{n}(f)=\gamma_{n}f^{(2n)}(\xi)/(2n)!, \tag{3.5.19}
$$

where


<a id="E20"></a>
$$
\gamma_{n}=\int_{a}^{b}p_{n}^{2}(x)w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x, \tag{3.5.20}
$$

and $\xi$ is some point in $(a,b)$ . As a consequence, the rule is exact for any polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $\leq 2n-1$ , that is,


<a id="E20_1"></a>
$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}f(x_{k}). \tag{3.5.20_1}
$$

In particular, with $h_{m}=\int_{a}^{b}p_{m}(x)^{2}w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ , we have a finite system of orthogonal polynomials $p_{m}(x)$ ( $m=0,1,\ldots,n-1$ ) on $\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}$ with respect to the weights $w_{k}$ :


<a id="E20_2"></a>
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_{\ell}(x_{k})p_{m}(x_{k})w_{k}=h_{m}\delta_{\ell,m}, \tag{3.5.20_2}
$$

In practical applications the weight function $w(x)$ is chosen to simulate the asymptotic behavior of the integrand as the endpoints are approached. For $C^{\infty}$ functions Gauss quadrature can be very efficient. In adaptive algorithms the evaluation of the nodes and weights may cause difficulties, unless exact values are known.

If $\alpha\neq 0$ this is called the *generalized Gauss–Laguerre formula* .

The nodes $x_{k}$ and weights $w_{k}$ for $\alpha=0$ and $n=5$ , $10$ are shown in Tables 3.5.6 and 3.5.7 . The $p_{n}(x)$ are the monic Laguerre polynomials $L_{n}\left(x\right)$ (§ [18.3](https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.3 "§18.3 Definitions ‣ Classical Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") ).

All the monic orthogonal polynomials $\{p_{n}\}$ used with Gauss quadrature satisfy a three-term recurrence relation (§ [18.2(iv)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.2#iv "§18.2(iv) Recurrence Relations ‣ §18.2 General Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ General Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") ):


<a id="E30"></a>
$$
xp_{n}(x)=p_{n+1}(x)+\alpha_{n}p_{n}(x)+\beta_{n}p_{n-1}(x), \tag{3.5.30}
$$

with $\beta_{n}>0$ , $p_{-1}(x)=0$ , and $p_{0}(x)=1$ . Then $h_{n}=\int_{a}^{b}p_{n}(x)^{2}w(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=h_{0}\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\ldots\beta_{n}$ . The corresponding orthonormal polynomials $q_{n}(x)=p_{n}(x)/\sqrt{h_{n}}$ satisfy the recurrence relation


<a id="E30_5"></a>
$$
xq_{n}(x)=\sqrt{\beta_{n+1}}\,q_{n+1}(x)+\alpha_{n}q_{n}(x)+\sqrt{\beta_{n}}q_{n-1}(x), \tag{3.5.30_5}
$$

with $q_{-1}(x)=0$ , and $q_{0}(x)=1/\sqrt{h_{0}}$ .

The monic and orthonormal recursion relations of this section are both closely related to the Lanczos recursion relation in § [3.2(vi)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/3.2#vi "§3.2(vi) Lanczos Tridiagonalization of a Symmetric Matrix ‣ §3.2 Linear Algebra ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") .

The Gauss nodes $x_{k}$ (the zeros of $p_{n}$ ) are the eigenvalues of the (symmetric tridiagonal) *Jacobi matrix* of order $n\times n$ :


<a id="E31"></a>
$$
\mathbf{J}_{n}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_{0}&\sqrt{\beta_{1}}&&&0\\
\sqrt{\beta_{1}}&\alpha_{1}&\sqrt{\beta_{2}}&&\\
&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\\
&&\sqrt{\beta_{n-2}}&\alpha_{n-2}&\sqrt{\beta_{n-1}}\\
0&&&\sqrt{\beta_{n-1}}&\alpha_{n-1}\end{bmatrix}. \tag{3.5.31}
$$

Let $\mathbf{v}_{k}$ denote the normalized eigenvector of $\mathbf{J}_{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $x_{k}$ . Then the weights are given by


<a id="E32"></a>
$$

Tables 3.5.1 – 3.5.13 can be verified by application of the results given in the present subsection. The monic version $p_{n}(x)$ and orthonormal version $q_{n}(x)$ of a classical orthogonal polynomial are obtained by dividing the orthogonal polynomial by $k_{n}$ respectively $\sqrt{h_{n}}$ , with $k_{n}$ and $h_{n}$ as in Table [18.3.1](https://dlmf.nist.gov/18.3#T1 "Table 18.3.1 ‣ §18.3 Definitions ‣ Classical Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") . Below we give for the classical orthogonal polynomials the recurrence coefficients $\alpha_{n}$ and $\beta_{n}$ in ( 3.5.30 ). These also immediately yield the recurrence coefficients in ( 3.5.30_5 ). In case of the Jacobi polynomials we have $p_{n}(x)=P^{(\alpha,\beta)}_{n}\left(x\right)/k_{n}$ , $q_{n}(x)=P^{(\alpha,\beta)}_{n}\left(x\right)/\sqrt{h_{n}}$ , and

Oscillatory integral transforms are treated in Wong ([1982](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/W#bib2436 "Quadrature formulas for oscillatory integral transforms")) by a method based on Gaussian quadrature. A comparison of several methods, including an extension of the Clenshaw–Curtis formula (§ 3.5(iv) ), is given in Evans and Webster ([1999](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/E#bib761 "A comparison of some methods for the evaluation of highly oscillatory integrals")).

For computing infinite oscillatory integrals, *Longman’s method* may be used. The integral is written as an alternating series of positive and negative subintegrals that are computed individually; see Longman ([1956](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/L#bib1447 "Note on a method for computing infinite integrals of oscillatory functions")). Convergence acceleration schemes, for example Levin’s transformation (§ [3.9(v)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/3.9#v "§3.9(v) Levin’s and Weniger’s Transformations ‣ §3.9 Acceleration of Convergence ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 3 Numerical Methods") ), can be used when evaluating the series. Further methods are given in Clendenin ([1966](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/C#bib522 "A method for numerical calculation of Fourier integrals")) and Lyness ([1985](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/L#bib1510 "Integrating some infinite oscillating tails")).

A frequent problem with contour integrals is heavy cancellation, which occurs especially when the value of the integral is exponentially small compared with the maximum absolute value of the integrand. To avoid cancellation we try to deform the path to pass through a saddle point in such a way that the maximum contribution of the integrand is derived from the neighborhood of the saddle point. For example, steepest descent paths can be used; see § [2.4(iv)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/2.4#iv "§2.4(iv) Saddle Points ‣ §2.4 Contour Integrals ‣ Areas ‣ Chapter 2 Asymptotic Approximations") .

In ( 3.5.35 ) take $s=1$ and $f(\zeta)=e^{-2\lambda\sqrt{\zeta}}$ , with $\lambda>0$ . When $\lambda$ is large the integral becomes exponentially small, and application of the quadrature rule of § 3.5(viii) is useless. In fact from ( [7.14.4](https://dlmf.nist.gov/7.14#E4 "(7.14.4) ‣ Laplace Transforms ‣ §7.14(i) Error Functions ‣ §7.14 Integrals ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 7 Error Functions, Dawson’s and Fresnel Integrals") ) and the inversion formula for the Laplace transform (§ [1.14(iii)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.14#iii "§1.14(iii) Laplace Transform ‣ §1.14 Integral Transforms ‣ Topics of Discussion ‣ Chapter 1 Algebraic and Analytic Methods") ) we have


<a id="E42"></a>
$$
\operatorname{erfc}\lambda=\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{i}}\int_{c-\mathrm{i}\infty}^{c+\mathrm{i}\infty}e^{\zeta-2\lambda\sqrt{\zeta}}\frac{\,\mathrm{d}\zeta}{\zeta}, \tag{3.5.42}
$$

where $\operatorname{erfc}z$ is the complementary error function, and from ( [7.12.1](https://dlmf.nist.gov/7.12#E1 "(7.12.1) ‣ §7.12(i) Complementary Error Function ‣ §7.12 Asymptotic Expansions ‣ Properties ‣ Chapter 7 Error Functions, Dawson’s and Fresnel Integrals") ) it follows that


<a id="E43"></a>
$$
\operatorname{erfc}\lambda\sim\frac{e^{-\lambda^{2}}}{\sqrt{\pi}\lambda}, \tag{3.5.43}
$$

With the transformation $\zeta=\lambda^{2}t$ , ( 3.5.42 ) becomes


<a id="E44"></a>
$$
\operatorname{erfc}\lambda=\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{i}}\int_{c-\mathrm{i}\infty}^{c+\mathrm{i}\infty}e^{\lambda^{2}(t-2\sqrt{t})}\frac{\,\mathrm{d}t}{t}, \tag{3.5.44}
$$

with saddle point at $t=1$ , and when $c=1$ the vertical path intersects the real axis at the saddle point. The steepest descent path is given by $\Im\left(t-2\sqrt{t}\right)=0$ , or in polar coordinates $t=re^{i\theta}$ we have $r={\sec}^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)$ . Thus


<a id="E45"></a>
$$
\operatorname{erfc}\lambda=\frac{e^{-\lambda^{2}}}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{-\lambda^{2}{\tan}^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)}\,\mathrm{d}\theta. \tag{3.5.45}
$$

The integrand can be extended as a periodic $C^{\infty}$ function on $\mathbb{R}$ with period $2\pi$ and as noted in § 3.5(i) , the trapezoidal rule is exceptionally efficient in this case.

Table 3.5.20 gives the results of applying the composite trapezoidal rule ( 3.5.2 ) with step size $h$ ; $n$ indicates the number of function values in the rule that are larger than $10^{-15}$ (we exploit the fact that the integrand is even). All digits shown in the approximation in the final row are correct.

A second example is provided in Gil et al. ([2001](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/G#bib921 "On nonoscillating integrals for computing inhomogeneous Airy functions")), where the method of contour integration is used to evaluate Scorer functions of complex argument (§ [9.12](https://dlmf.nist.gov/9.12 "§9.12 Scorer Functions ‣ Related Functions ‣ Chapter 9 Airy and Related Functions") ). See also Gil et al. ([2003b](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/G#bib927 "Computing special functions by using quadrature rules")).

If $f$ is meromorphic, with poles near the saddle point, then the foregoing method can be modified. A special case is the rule for Hilbert transforms (§ [1.14(v)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.14#v "§1.14(v) Hilbert Transform ‣ §1.14 Integral Transforms ‣ Topics of Discussion ‣ Chapter 1 Algebraic and Analytic Methods") ):

where the integral is the Cauchy principal value. See Kress and Martensen ([1970](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/K#bib1347 "Anwendung der Rechteckregel auf die reelle Hilberttransformation mit unendlichem Intervall")).

Other contour integrals occur in standard integral transforms or their inverses, for example, Hankel transforms (§ [10.22(v)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/10.22#v "§10.22(v) Hankel Transform ‣ §10.22 Integrals ‣ Bessel and Hankel Functions ‣ Chapter 10 Bessel Functions") ), Kontorovich–Lebedev transforms (§ [10.43(v)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/10.43#v "§10.43(v) Kontorovich–Lebedev Transform ‣ §10.43 Integrals ‣ Modified Bessel Functions ‣ Chapter 10 Bessel Functions") ), and Mellin transforms (§ [1.14(iv)](https://dlmf.nist.gov/1.14#iv "§1.14(iv) Mellin Transform ‣ §1.14 Integral Transforms ‣ Topics of Discussion ‣ Chapter 1 Algebraic and Analytic Methods") ).

Table 3.5.21 supplies cubature rules, including *weights* $w_{j}$ , for the disk $D$ , given by $x^{2}+y^{2}\leq h^{2}$ :


<a id="E47"></a>
$$
\frac{1}{\pi h^{2}}\iint_{D}f(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y=\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{j}f(x_{j},y_{j})+R, \tag{3.5.47}
$$

and the square $S$ , given by $\left|x\right|\leq h$ , $\left|y\right|\leq h$ :


<a id="E48"></a>
$$
\frac{1}{4h^{2}}\iint_{S}f(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y=\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{j}f(x_{j},y_{j})+R. \tag{3.5.48}
$$

For these results and further information on cubature formulas see Cools ([2003](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/C#bib576 "An encyclopaedia of cubature formulas")).

For integrals in higher dimensions, *Monte Carlo methods* are another—often the only—alternative. The standard Monte Carlo method samples points uniformly from the integration region to estimate the integral and its error. In more advanced methods points are sampled from a probability distribution, so that they are concentrated in regions that make the largest contribution to the integral. With $N$ function values, the Monte Carlo method aims at an error of order $1/\sqrt{N}$ , independently of the dimension of the domain of integration. See Davis and Rabinowitz ([1984](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/D#bib618 "Methods of Numerical Integration"), pp. 384–417) and Schürer ([2004](./https://dlmf.nist.gov/bib/S#bib2021 "Adaptive Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration Based on MISER and VEGAS")).
