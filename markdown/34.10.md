Annotations for Ch.34
:::

In a $\mathit{3j}$ symbol, if the three angular momenta $j_{1},j_{2},j_{3}$ do not satisfy the triangle conditions ( 34.2.1 ), or if the projective quantum numbers do not satisfy ( 34.2.3 ), then the $\mathit{3j}$ symbol is zero. Similarly the $\mathit{6j}$ symbol ( 34.4.1 ) vanishes when the triangle conditions are not satisfied by any of the four $\mathit{3j}$ symbols in the summation. Such zeros are called *trivial zeros* . However, the $\mathit{3j}$ and $\mathit{6j}$ symbols may vanish for certain combinations of the angular momenta and projective quantum numbers even when the triangle conditions are fulfilled. Such zeros are called *nontrivial zeros* .

For further information, including examples of nontrivial zeros and extensions to $\mathit{9j}$ symbols, see Srinivasa Rao and Rajeswari ([1993](./bib/S.html#bib2148 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum: Selected Topics"), pp. 133–215, 294–295, 299–310).
