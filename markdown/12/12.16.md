Annotations for Ch.12
:::

PCFs are used as basic approximating functions in the theory of contour integrals with a coalescing saddle point and an algebraic singularity, and in the theory of differential equations with two coalescing turning points; see §§ 2.4(vi) and 2.8(vi) . For examples see §§ 13.20(iii) , 13.20(iv) , 14.15(v) , and [14.26](./14.26.md "§14.26 Uniform Asymptotic Expansions ‣ Complex Arguments ‣ Chapter 14 Legendre and Related Functions") .

Sleeman ([1968b](./bib/S.html#bib2110 "On parabolic cylinder functions")) considers certain orthogonality properties of the PCFs and corresponding eigenvalues. In Brazel et al. ([1992](./bib/B.html#bib343 "Exponential asymptotics for an eigenvalue of a problem involving parabolic cylinder functions")) exponential asymptotics are considered in connection with an eigenvalue problem involving PCFs.

PCFs are also used in integral transforms with respect to the parameter, and inversion formulas exist for kernels containing PCFs. See Erdélyi ([1941a](./bib/E.html#bib745 "Generating functions of certain continuous orthogonal systems")), Cherry ([1948](./bib/C.html#bib483 "Expansions in terms of parabolic cylinder functions")), and Lowdon ([1970](./bib/L.html#bib1475 "Integral representation of the Hankel function in terms of parabolic cylinder functions")). Integral transforms and sampling expansions are considered in Jerri ([1982](./bib/J.html#bib1169 "A note on sampling expansion for a transform with parabolic cylinder kernel")).
