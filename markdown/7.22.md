The methods available for computing the main functions in this chapter are analogous to those described in §§ 6.18(i) – 6.18(iv) for the exponential integral and sine and cosine integrals, and similar comments apply. Additional references are Matta and Reichel ([1971](./bib/M.html#bib1566 "Uniform computation of the error function and other related functions")) for the application of the trapezoidal rule, for example, to the first of ( 7.7.2 ), and Gautschi ([1970](./bib/G.html#bib879 "Efficient computation of the complex error function")) and Cuyt et al. ([2008](./bib/C.html#bib608 "Handbook of Continued Fractions for Special Functions")) for continued fractions.

The recursion scheme given by ( 7.18.1 ) and ( 7.18.7 ) can be used for computing $\mathop{\mathrm{i}^{n}\mathrm{erfc}}\left(x\right)$ . See Gautschi ([1977a](./bib/G.html#bib884 "Evaluation of the repeated integrals of the coerror function")), where forward and backward recursions are used; see also Gautschi ([1961](./bib/G.html#bib872 "Recursive computation of the repeated integrals of the error function")).

The computation of these functions can be based on algorithms for the complementary error function with complex argument; compare ( 7.19.3 ).
