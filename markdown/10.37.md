**Notes:**

See Olver ([1997b](./bib/O.html#bib1809 "Asymptotics and Special Functions"), pp. 251–252). For ( 10.37.1 ) see Everitt and Jones ([1977](./bib/E.html#bib763 "On an integral inequality"), (8.5)) which contains an error. Formula (8.5) holds for $|\theta|\leq\tfrac{1}{2}\pi$ only. Hence the sector of validity of ( 10.37.1 ) is not $|\operatorname{ph}z|<\pi$ as was previously mentioned.

**Errata (effective with 1.0.17):**

For ( 10.37.1 ), it was originally stated incorrectly that ( 10.37.1 ) holds for $|\operatorname{ph}z|<\pi$ . See Everitt and Jones ([1977](./bib/E.html#bib763 "On an integral inequality"), (8.5)), which makes this incorrect claim. *Reported 2017-11-14 by Gergő Nemes*

**Addition (effective with 1.0.11):**

The reference to Gaunt ([2014](./bib/G.html#bib2866 "Inequalities for modified Bessel functions and their integrals")) was added.

**Addition (effective with 1.0.7):**

The reference to Segura ([2011](./bib/S.html#bib2819 "Bounds for ratios of modified Bessel functions and associated Turán-type inequalities")) has been added at the end of this section.

Annotations for Ch.10
:::

If $\nu$ $(\geq 0)$ is fixed, then throughout the interval $0<x<\infty$ , $I_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ is positive and increasing, and $K_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ is positive and decreasing.

If $x$ $(>0)$ is fixed, then throughout the interval $0<\nu<\infty$ , $I_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ is decreasing, and $K_{\nu}\left(x\right)$ is increasing.

For sharper inequalities when the variables are real see Paris ([1984](./bib/P.html#bib1831 "An inequality for the Bessel function ⁢ J ν ( ⁢ ν x )")) and Laforgia ([1991](./bib/L.html#bib1364 "Bounds for modified Bessel functions")).

If $0\leq\nu<\mu$ and $|\operatorname{ph}z|\leq\tfrac{1}{2}\pi$ , then

$$
|K_{\nu}\left(z\right)|<|K_{\mu}\left(z\right)|. \tag{10.37.1}
$$

Note that previously we did mention that ( 10.37.1 ) holds for $|\operatorname{ph}z|<\pi$ . This is definitely not the case.
