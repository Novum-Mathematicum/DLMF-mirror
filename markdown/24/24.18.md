Annotations for Ch.24
:::

Bernoulli polynomials appear in statistical physics (Ordóñez and Driebe ([1996](./bib/O.html#bib2604 "Spectral decomposition of tent maps using symmetry considerations"))), in discussions of Casimir forces (Li et al. ([1991](./bib/L.html#bib2607 "Generalized Riemann ζ -function regularization and Casimir energy for a piecewise uniform string"))), and in a study of quark-gluon plasma (Meisinger et al. ([2002](./bib/M.html#bib2606 "Phenomenological equations of state for the quark-gluon plasma"))).

Euler polynomials also appear in statistical physics as well as in semi-classical approximations to quantum probability distributions (Ballentine and McRae ([1998](./bib/B.html#bib2605 "Moment equations for probability distributions in classical and quantum mechanics"))).
