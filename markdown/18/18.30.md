**Modification (effective with 1.2.0):**

The introductory text in the first paragraph of this section was carefully expanded into two detailed paragraphs which contains ( 18.30.1 )–( 18.30.3 ). The remainder of the pre-existing section covered associated Jacobi polynomials which became the new Subsection 18.30(i) with ( 18.30.4 )–( 18.30.5 ); and the associated Legendre polynomials which became the new Subsection 18.30(ii) with ( 18.30.6 )–( 18.30.7 ). The final paratraph of the pre-existing section was greatly expanded with the new added subsections 18.30(iii) – 18.30(viii) . Within these new added subsections, Equations ( 18.30.8 )– 18.30.31 were added.

Assuming equation ( 18.2.8 ) with its initialization defines a set of OP’s, $p_{n}(x)$ , the corresponding *associated orthogonal polynomials* of order $c$ are the $p_{n}(x;c)$ as defined by shifting the index $n$ in the recurrence coefficients by adding a constant $c$ , functions of $n$ , say $f(n)$ , being replaced by $f(n+c)$ . The inequality $A_{n}A_{n+1}C_{n+1}>0$ , for $n\geq 0$ is replaced by


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
A_{n+c}A_{n+c+1}C_{n+c+1}>0, \tag{18.30.1}
$$

The constant $c$ is usually taken as a positive integer. However, if the recurrence coefficients are polynomial, or rational, functions of $n$ , polynomials of degree $n$ may be well defined for $c\in\mathbb{R}$ provided that $A_{n+c}B_{n+c}\neq 0,n=0,1,\dots$ Askey and Wimp ([1984](./bib/index.html#bib2988 "Associated Laguerre and Hermite polynomials")).

The order $c$ recurrence is initialized as

<a id="E2"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle p_{-1}(x;c) \displaystyle=0, \tag{18.30.2}
$$

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle p_{0}(x;c) \displaystyle=1,
$$

and then for consecutive $n=0,1,2,\dots$

Associated polynomials and the related corecursive polynomials appear in Ismail ([2009](./bib/I.html#bib2902 "Classical and Quantum Orthogonal Polynomials in One Variable"), §§2.3, 2.6, and 2.10), where the relationship of OP’s to continued fractions is made evident. The lowest order monic versions of both of these appear in § 18.2(x) , ( 18.2.31 ) defining the $c=1$ associated monic polynomials, and ( 18.2.32 ) their closely related cousins the $c=0$ corecursive polynomials.

Annotations for §18.30 and Ch.18
:::

Defining associated orthogonal polynomials and their relationship to their corecursive counterparts is particularly simple via use of the recursion relations for the monic, rather than via those for the traditional polynomials. The simplicity of the relationship follows from the fact that the monic polynomials have been rescaled so that the coefficient of the highest power of $x$ in $p_{n}(x)$ , namely, $x^{n}$ , is unity; for a note on this standardization, see § 18.2(iii) . The notations $\hat{p}_{n}(x;c)$ and $\hat{p}_{n}^{(0)}(x)$ are used here to distinguish the two sets of *monic* polynomials from the (traditional) polynomials $p_{n}(x;c)$ and $p_{n}^{(0)}(x)$ of the preceding subsection.

### Relationship of Monic Corecursive and Monic Associated OP’s

It is easily seen that $\hat{p}_{2}^{(0)}(x)=\hat{p}_{1}(x;1)=x-\alpha_{1}$ , and then


<a id="E29"></a>
$$
\hat{p}_{n}^{(0)}(x)=\hat{p}_{n-1}(x;1) \tag{18.30.29}
$$

follows by induction on $n$ . This being the relationship established in § 18.2(x) following ( 18.2.32 ). The usage of § 18.2(x) , where the monic associated polynomials, there denoted $p_{n}^{(1)}(x)$ , instead of $\hat{p}_{n}(x;1)$ , are referred to as the *first associated* such polynomials in § 18.2(x) , is now evident. The ratio $\hat{p}_{n-1}(x;1)/\hat{p}_{n}(x)$ is then the $F_{n}(x)$ of ( 18.2.35 ), leading to Markov’s theorem as stated in ( 18.30.25 ).

More generally, the $k$ th corecursive monic polynomials (defined with the initialization of ( 18.30.28 ) followed by the $c=k$ recurrence of ( 18.30.27 )) are related to the $(k+1)$ st monic associated polynomials by


<a id="E30"></a>
$$
\hat{p}_{n}^{(k)}(x)=\hat{p}_{n-1}(x;k+1). \tag{18.30.30}
$$

See Ismail ([2009](./bib/I.html#bib2902 "Classical and Quantum Orthogonal Polynomials in One Variable"), p. 46 ), where the $k$ th corecursive polynomial is also related to an appropriate continued fraction, given here as its $n$ th convergent,


<a id="E31"></a>
$$
F_{n}(x,k)=\hat{p}_{n}^{(k)}(x)/\hat{p}_{n}(x;k). \tag{18.30.31}
$$

For associated Askey–Wilson polynomials see Rahman ([2001](./bib/R.html#bib1919 "The Associated Classical Orthogonal Polynomials")). The type 3 Pollaczek polynomials are the associated type 2 Pollaczek polynomials, see § [18.35](./18.35.md "§18.35 Pollaczek Polynomials ‣ Other Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") . The relationship ( 18.35.8 ) implies the definition for the associated ultraspherical polynomials $C_{n}^{(\lambda)}(x;c)=P^{{(\lambda)}}_{n}\left(x;0,0,c\right)$ .
