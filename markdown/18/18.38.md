The monic Chebyshev polynomial $2^{1-n}T_{n}\left(x\right)$ , $n\geq 1$ , enjoys the ‘minimax’ property on the interval $[-1,1]$ , that is, $|2^{1-n}T_{n}\left(x\right)|$ has the least maximum value among all monic polynomials of degree $n$ . In consequence, expansions of functions that are infinitely differentiable on $[-1,1]$ in series of Chebyshev polynomials usually converge extremely rapidly. For these results and applications in approximation theory see § 3.11(ii) and Mason and Handscomb ([2003](./bib/M.html#bib1560 "Chebyshev Polynomials"), Chapter 3), Cheney ([1982](./bib/C.html#bib481 "Introduction to Approximation Theory"), p. 108), and Rivlin ([1969](./bib/R.html#bib1957 "An Introduction to the Approximation of Functions"), p. 31).

Linear ordinary differential equations can be solved directly in series of Chebyshev polynomials (or other OP’s) by a method originated by Clenshaw ([1957](./bib/C.html#bib524 "The numerical solution of linear differential equations in Chebyshev series")). This process has been generalized to spectral methods for solving partial differential equations. For further information see Mason and Handscomb ([2003](./bib/M.html#bib1560 "Chebyshev Polynomials"), Chapters 10 and 11), Gottlieb and Orszag ([1977](./bib/G.html#bib963 "Numerical Analysis of Spectral Methods: Theory and Applications"), pp. 7–19), and Guo ([1998](./bib/G.html#bib1002 "Spectral Methods and Their Applications"), pp. 120–151).

Classical OP’s play a fundamental role in Gaussian quadrature. If the nodes in a quadrature formula with a positive weight function are chosen to be the zeros of the $n$ th degree OP with the same weight function, and the interval of orthogonality is the same as the integration range, then the weights in the quadrature formula can be chosen in such a way that the formula is exact for all polynomials of degree not exceeding $2n-1$ . See § 3.5(v) .

The basic ideas of Gaussian quadrature, and their extensions to non-classical weight functions, and the computation of the corresponding quadrature abscissas and weights, have led to *discrete variable representations* , or DVRs, of Sturm–Liouville and other differential operators. The terminology DVR arises as an otherwise continuous variable, such as the co-ordinate $x$ , is replaced by its values at a finite set of zeros of appropriate OP’s resulting in expansions using functions localized at these points. Light and Carrington Jr. ([2000](./bib/L.html#bib3046 "Discrete-variable representations and their utilization")) review and extend the one-dimensional analysis to solution of multi-dimensional many-particle systems, where the sparse nature of the resulting matrices is highly advantageous. Schneider et al. ([2016](./bib/S.html#bib3076 "Time propagation of partial differential equations using the short iterative Lanczos method and finite-element discrete variable representation")) discuss DVR/Finite Element solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Each of these typically require a particular non-classical weight functions and analysis of the corresponding OP’s. These are listed in § 18.39(iii) . These methods have become known as *pseudo-spectral* , and are overviewed in Cerjan ([1993](./bib/C.html#bib3001 "Numerical Grid Methods and Their Application to Schrödinger’s Equation")), and Shizgal ([2015](./bib/S.html#bib3080 "Spectral Methods in Chemistry and Physics.

The Toda equation provides an important model of a completely integrable system. It has elegant structures, including $N$ -soliton solutions, Lax pairs, and Bäcklund transformations. While the Toda equation is an important model of nonlinear systems, the special functions of mathematical physics are usually regarded as solutions to linear equations. However, by using Hirota’s technique of bilinear formalism of soliton theory, Nakamura ([1996](./bib/N.html#bib1688 "Toda equation and its solutions in special functions")) shows that a wide class of exact solutions of the Toda equation can be expressed in terms of various special functions, and in particular classical OP’s. For instance,


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
V_{n}(x)=\frac{2nH_{n+1}\left(x\right)H_{n-1}\left(x\right)}{(H_{n}\left(x\right))^{2}}, \tag{18.38.1}
$$

with $H_{n}\left(x\right)$ as in § [18.3](./18.3.md "§18.3 Definitions ‣ Classical Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") , satisfies the Toda equation


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}}{{\mathrm{d}x}^{2}}\ln V_{n}(x)=V_{n+1}(x)+V_{n-1}(x)-2V_{n}(x), \tag{18.38.2}

The *Dunkl operator* , introduced by Dunkl ([1989](./bib/D.html#bib3006 "Differential-difference operators associated to reflection groups")), is an operator associated with reflection groups or root systems which has terms involving first order partial derivatives and reflection terms. Analogues of the original Dunkl operator (the rational case) were introduced by Heckman and Cherednik for the trigonometric case, and by Cherednik for the $q$ -case. Algebraic structures were built of which special representations involve Dunkl type operators. In the $q$ -case this algebraic structure is called the *double affine Hecke algebra* (DAHA), introduced by Cherednik. Eigenvalue equations involving Dunkl type operators have as eigenfunctions nonsymmetric analogues of multivariable special functions associated with root systems. This gives also new structures and results in the one-variable case, but the obtained nonsymmetric special functions can now usually be written as a linear combination of two known special functions.

In the one-variable case the Dunkl operator eigenvalue equation

$$
f^{\prime}(x)+\left(\alpha+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\frac{f(x)-f(-x)}{x}=\mathrm{i}\lambda f(x) \tag{18.38.10}
$$

has a solution

$$
f(x)=\Gamma\left(\alpha+1\right)\left(\frac{2}{\lambda x}\right)^{\alpha}\Bigl{(}J_{\alpha}\left(\lambda x\right)+\mathrm{i}J_{\alpha+1}\left(\lambda x\right)\Bigr{)}, \tag{18.38.11}
$$

where the Bessel function $J_{\nu}\left(z\right)$ is defined in ( 10.2.2 ).

For the one-variable $q$ -case see Noumi and Stokman ([2004](./bib/N.html#bib3059 "Askey-Wilson polynomials: an affine Hecke algebra approach")), Koornwinder ([2007a](./bib/K.html#bib3037 "The relationship between Zhedanov’s algebra ⁢ AW ( 3 ) and the double affine Hecke algebra in the rank one case"), §§3,4), Koornwinder and Bouzeffour ([2011](./bib/K.html#bib3038 "Nonsymmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials as vector-valued polynomials"), §§4,5) and Terwilliger ([2013](./bib/T.html#bib3085 "The universal Askey-Wilson algebra and DAHA of type ( C ∨ 1 , C 1 )")). The Dunkl type operator is a $q$ -difference-reflection operator acting on Laurent polynomials and its eigenfunctions, the nonsymmetric Askey–Wilson polynomials, are linear combinations of the symmetric Laurent polynomial $R_{n}(z;a,b,c,d\,|\,q)$ and the ‘anti-symmetric’ Laurent polynomial $z^{-1}(1-az)(1-bz)R_{n-1}(z;qa,qb,c,d\,|\,q)$ , where $R_{n}(z)$ is given in ( 18.28.1_5 ). See Koornwinder ([2007a](./bib/K.html#bib3037 "The relationship between Zhedanov’s algebra ⁢ AW ( 3 ) and the double affine Hecke algebra in the rank one case"), (3.13), (4.9), (4.10)) for explicit formulas.

Dunkl type operators and nonsymmetric polynomials have been associated with various other families in the Askey scheme and $q$ -Askey scheme, in particular with Wilson polynomials, see Groenevelt ([2007](./bib/G.html#bib3026 "Fourier transforms related to a root system of rank 1")), and with Jacobi polynomials, see Koornwinder and Bouzeffour ([2011](./bib/K.html#bib3038 "Nonsymmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials as vector-valued polynomials"), §7).

:::

The solved Schrödinger equations of § 18.39(i) involve *shape invariant* potentials, and thus are in the family of *supersymmetric* or *SUSY* potentials. SUSY leads to algebraic simplifications in generating excited states, and *partner potentials* with closely related energy spectra, from knowledge of a single ground state wave function. These generalize the *ladder operators* , as reviewed and extended by Infeld and Hull ([1951](./bib/I.html#bib3032 "The factorization method")), and also called *creation and annilhilation* operators. Overviews appear in Dutt et al. ([1988](./bib/D.html#bib3007 "Supersymmetry, shape invariance, and exactly solvable potentials")), Cooper et al. ([1995](./bib/C.html#bib3003 "Supersymmetry and quantum mechanics")), and Quesne ([2011](./bib/Q.html#bib3094 "Higher-Order SUSY, Exactly Solvable Potentials, and Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomials")).

:::

Exceptional OP’s (EOP’s) are those which are ‘missing’ a finite number of lower order polynomials, but yet form complete sets with respect to suitable measures. Detailed examples appear in the Section on Miscellaneous OP’s §§ 18.36(v) and 18.36(vi) . A review is Milson ([2017](./bib/M.html#bib3054 "Exceptional orthogonal polynomials")). Hermite EOP’s appear in solutions of a rationally modified Schrödinger equation in § [18.39](./18.39.md "§18.39 Applications in the Physical Sciences ‣ Applications ‣ Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") . Much of the exploration of the EOP’s is based on the operator algebra as developed in SUSY, above.
