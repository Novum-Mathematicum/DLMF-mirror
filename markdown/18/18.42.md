Annotations for Ch.18
:::

In this section we provide links to the research literature describing the implementation of algorithms in software for the evaluation of functions described in this chapter. Also included is a website (CAOP) operated by a university department. Citations in the bulleted list refer to papers for which research software has been made available and can be downloaded via the Web.

A more complete list of available software for computing these functions, and for generating formulas symbolically, is found in the [Software Index](./software/index.md) . For another listing of Web-accessible software for the functions in this chapter, see [GAMS (class C3)](https://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Class/C3/) .
