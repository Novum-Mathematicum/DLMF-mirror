Annotations for Ch.31
:::

A further extension of the notation ( 31.4.1 ) and ( 31.4.3 ) is given by


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
(s_{1},s_{2})\mathit{Hf}_{m}^{\nu}\left(a,q_{m};\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z\right), \tag{31.6.1}
$$

with $(s_{1},s_{2})\in\{0,1,a\}$ , but with another set of $\{q_{m}\}$ . This denotes a set of solutions of ( 31.2.1 ) with the property that if we pass around a simple closed contour in the $z$ -plane that encircles $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ once in the positive sense, but not the remaining finite singularity, then the solution is multiplied by a constant factor ${\mathrm{e}}^{2\nu\pi i}$ . These solutions are called *path-multiplicative* . See Schmidt ([1979](./bib/S.html#bib2011 "Die Lösung der linearen Differentialgleichung 2. Ordnung um zwei einfache Singularitäten durch Reihen nach hypergeometrischen Funktionen")).
