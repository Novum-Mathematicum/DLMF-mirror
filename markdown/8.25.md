Although the series expansions in §§ [8.7](./8.7.md "§8.7 Series Expansions ‣ Incomplete Gamma Functions ‣ Chapter 8 Incomplete Gamma and Related Functions") , 8.19(iv) , and 8.21(vi) converge for all finite values of $z$ , they are cumbersome to use when $|z|$ is large owing to slowness of convergence and cancellation. For large $|z|$ the corresponding asymptotic expansions (generally divergent) are used instead. See also Luke ([1975](./bib/L.html#bib1501 "Mathematical Functions and their Approximations"), pp. 101–102) and Temme ([1994b](./bib/T.html#bib2225 "Computational aspects of incomplete gamma functions with large complex parameters")).

DiDonato and Morris ([1986](./bib/D.html#bib656 "Computation of the incomplete gamma function ratios and their inverses")) describes an algorithm for computing $P\left(a,x\right)$ and $Q\left(a,x\right)$ for $a\geq 0$ , $x\geq 0$ , and $a+x\neq 0$ from the uniform expansions in § [8.12](./8.12.md "§8.12 Uniform Asymptotic Expansions for Large Parameter ‣ Incomplete Gamma Functions ‣ Chapter 8 Incomplete Gamma and Related Functions") . The algorithm supplies 14S accuracy. A numerical inversion procedure is also given for calculating the value of $x$ (with 10S accuracy), when $a$ and $P\left(a,x\right)$ are specified, based on Newton’s rule (§ 3.8(ii) ). See also Temme ([1987](./bib/T.html#bib2561 "On the computation of the incomplete gamma functions for large values of the parameters"), [1994b](./bib/T.html#bib2225 "Computational aspects of incomplete gamma functions with large complex parameters")).

The computation of $\gamma\left(a,z\right)$ and $\Gamma\left(a,z\right)$ by means of continued fractions is described in Jones and Thron ([1985](./bib/J.html#bib1183 "On the computation of incomplete gamma functions in the complex domain")) and Gautschi ([1979b](./bib/G.html#bib886 "A computational procedure for incomplete gamma functions"), §§4.3, 5). See also Jacobsen et al. ([1986](./bib/J.html#bib1155 "Further results on the computation of incomplete gamma functions")) and Temme ([1996b](./bib/T.html#bib2230 "Special Functions: An Introduction to the Classical Functions of Mathematical Physics"), p. 280).


## §8.25(v) Recurrence Relations

Annotations for §8.25 and Ch.8
:::

Expansions involving incomplete gamma functions often require the generation of sequences $P\left(a+n,x\right)$ , $Q\left(a+n,x\right)$ , or $\gamma^{*}\left(a+n,x\right)$ for fixed $a$ and $n=0,1,2,\dots$ . An efficient procedure, based partly on the recurrence relations ( 8.8.5 ) and ( 8.8.6 ), is described in Gautschi ([1979b](./bib/G.html#bib886 "A computational procedure for incomplete gamma functions"), [1999](./bib/G.html#bib896 "A note on the recursive calculation of incomplete gamma functions")).

Stable recursive schemes for the computation of $E_{p}\left(x\right)$ are described in Miller ([1960](./bib/M.html#bib1616 "Tables of Generalized Exponential Integrals")) for $x>0$ and integer $p$ . For $x>0$ and real $p$ see Amos ([1980b](./bib/index.html#bib73 "Computation of exponential integrals")) and Chiccoli et al. ([1987](./bib/C.html#bib485 "A numerical method for generalized exponential integrals"), [1988](./bib/C.html#bib486 "On the evaluation of generalized exponential integrals ⁢ E v ( x )")). See also Chiccoli et al. ([1990a](./bib/C.html#bib487 "An algorithm for exponential integrals of real order")) and Stegun and Zucker ([1974](./bib/S.html#bib2161 "Automatic computing methods for special functions. II. The exponential integral ⁢ E n ( x )")).
