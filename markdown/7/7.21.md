**Addition (effective with 1.0.10):**

A sentence in [7.21](./7.21.md "§7.21 Physical Applications ‣ Applications ‣ Chapter 7 Error Functions, Dawson’s and Fresnel Integrals") was added to emphasize application of the Faddeeva/Voigt function to problems in physics. A reference Wells ([1999](./bib/W.html#bib2164 "Rapid approximation to the Voigt/Faddeeva function and its derivatives")) is provided which contains some efficient Fortran subroutines in the appendices to compute the Faddeeva/Voigt function and its derivatives when only limited accuracy is required. *Suggested 2014-09-24 by Charles Clark*

Annotations for Ch.7
:::

The error functions, Fresnel integrals, and related functions occur in a variety of physical applications. Fresnel integrals and Cornu’s spiral occurred originally in the analysis of the diffraction of light; see Born and Wolf ([1999](./bib/B.html#bib2569 "Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light"), §8.7). More recently, Cornu’s spiral appears in the design of highways and railroad tracks, robot trajectory planning, and computer-aided design; see Meek and Walton ([1992](./bib/M.html#bib2566 "Clothoid spline transition spirals")).

Carslaw and Jaeger ([1959](./bib/C.html#bib457 "Conduction of Heat in Solids")) gives many applications and points out the importance of the repeated integrals of the complementary error function $\mathop{\mathrm{i}^{n}\mathrm{erfc}}\left(z\right)$ . Fried and Conte ([1961](./bib/F.html#bib840 "The Plasma Dispersion Function: The Hilbert Transform of the Gaussian")) mentions the role of $w\left(z\right)$ in the theory of linearized waves or oscillations in a hot plasma; $w\left(z\right)$ is called the *plasma dispersion function* or *Faddeeva (or Faddeyeva) function* ; see Faddeeva and Terent’ev ([1954](./bib/F.html#bib766 "Tablicy značeniĭ funkcii = ⁢ w ( z ) ⁢ e - z 2 ( + 1 ⁢ ⁢ 2 i π ∫ z 0 ⁢ e t 2 d t ) ot kompleksnogo argumenta")). Ng and Geller ([1969](./bib/N.html#bib1716 "A table of integrals of the error functions")) cites work with applications from atomic physics and astrophysics. Efficient algorithms for computing the Faddeeva (or Faddeyeva) function are discussed in Wells ([1999](./bib/W.html#bib2164 "Rapid approximation to the Voigt/Faddeeva function and its derivatives")), a paper frequently cited in the astrophysics literature.

Voigt functions $\mathsf{U}\left(x,t\right)$ , $\mathsf{V}\left(x,t\right)$ , can be regarded as the convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian, and appear when the analysis of light (or particulate) absorption (or emission) involves thermal motion effects. These applications include astrophysics, plasma diagnostics, neutron diffraction, laser spectroscopy, and surface scattering. See Mitchell and Zemansky ([1961](./bib/M.html#bib1639 "Resonance Radiation and Excited Atoms"), §IV.2), Armstrong ([1967](./bib/index.html#bib131 "Spectrum line profiles: The Voigt function")), and Ahn et al. ([2001](./bib/index.html#bib2567 "Ly α line formation in starbursting galaxies. I. Moderately thick, dustless, and static H i media")). Dawson’s integral appears in de-convolving even more complex motional effects; see Pratt ([2007](./bib/P.html#bib2568 "Comoving coordinate system for relativistic hydrodynamics")).
