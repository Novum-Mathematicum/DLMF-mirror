:::

Many special functions that depend on parameters satisfy a three-term linear recurrence relation


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
{w(n+2)+f(n)w(n+1)+g(n)w(n)=0}, \tag{2.9.1}
$$

or equivalently the second-order homogeneous linear difference equation


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
\Delta^{2}w(n)+(2+f(n))\Delta w(n)+(1+f(n)+g(n))w(n)=0, \tag{2.9.2}
$$

in which $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator (§ 3.6(i) ).

Often $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ can be expanded in series

<a id="E3"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle f(n) \displaystyle\sim\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{f_{s}}{n^{s}}, \tag{2.9.3}

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle g(n) \displaystyle\sim\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{g_{s}}{n^{s}}
$$

with $g_{0}\neq 0$ . (For the case $g_{0}=0$ see the final paragraph of § 2.9(ii) with $Q$ negative.) This situation is analogous to second-order homogeneous linear differential equations with an irregular singularity of rank 1 at infinity (§ 2.7(ii) ). Formal solutions are


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
\rho_{j}^{n}n^{\alpha_{j}}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{s,j}}{n^{s}}, \tag{2.9.4}
$$

where $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$ are the roots of the *characteristic equation*


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
\rho^{2}+f_{0}\rho+g_{0}=0, \tag{2.9.5}
$$


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
\alpha_{j}=(f_{1}\rho_{j}+g_{1})/(f_{0}\rho_{j}+2g_{0}), \tag{2.9.6}
$$

$a_{0,j}=1$ , and


<a id="E7"></a>
$$
\rho_{j}(f_{0}+2\rho_{j})sa_{s,j}=\sum_{r=1}^{s}\left(\rho_{j}^{2}2^{r+1}\genfrac{(}{)}{0.0pt}{}{\alpha_{j}+r-s}{r+1}+\rho_{j}\sum_{q=0}^{r+1}\genfrac{(}{)}{0.0pt}{}{\alpha_{j}+r-s}{r+1-q}f_{q}+g_{r+1}\right)a_{s-r,j}, \tag{2.9.7}
$$

$s=1,2,3,\dots$ . The construction fails if $\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}$ , that is, when $f_{0}^{2}=4g_{0}$ .

When $f_{0}^{2}\neq 4g_{0}$ , there are linearly independent solutions $w_{j}(n)$ , $j=1,2$ , such that


<a id="E8"></a>
$$
w_{j}(n)\sim\rho_{j}^{n}n^{\alpha_{j}}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{s,j}}{n^{s}}, \tag{2.9.8}
$$

If $|\rho_{2}|>|\rho_{1}|$ , or if $|\rho_{2}|=|\rho_{1}|$ and $\Re\alpha_{2}>\Re\alpha_{1}$ , then $w_{1}(n)$ is recessive and $w_{2}(n)$ is dominant as $n\to\infty$ . As in the case of differential equations (§§ 2.7(iii) , 2.7(iv) ) recessive solutions are unique and dominant solutions are not; furthermore, one member of a numerically satisfactory pair has to be recessive. When $|\rho_{2}|=|\rho_{1}|$ and $\Re\alpha_{2}=\Re\alpha_{1}$ neither solution is dominant and both are unique.

Annotations for §2.9 and Ch.2
:::

When the roots of ( 2.9.5 ) are equal we denote them both by $\rho$ . Assume first $2g_{1}\neq f_{0}f_{1}$ . Then ( 2.9.1 ) has independent solutions $w_{j}(n)$ , $j=1,2$ , such that


<a id="E9"></a>
$$
w_{j}(n)\sim\rho^{n}\exp\left((-1)^{j}\kappa\sqrt{n}\right)n^{\alpha}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{js}\frac{c_{s}}{n^{s/2}}, \tag{2.9.9}
$$

where


<a id="E10"></a>
$$
\sqrt{g_{0}}\kappa=\sqrt{2f_{0}f_{1}-4g_{1}}, \tag{2.9.10}
$$

$c_{0}=1$ , and higher coefficients are determined by formal substitution.

Alternatively, suppose that $2g_{1}=f_{0}f_{1}$ . Then the indices $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$ are the roots of


<a id="E11"></a>
$$
2g_{0}\alpha^{2}-(f_{0}f_{1}+2g_{0})\alpha+2g_{2}-f_{0}f_{2}=0. \tag{2.9.11}
$$

Provided that $\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}$ is not zero or an integer, ( 2.9.1 ) has independent solutions $w_{j}(n)$ , $j=1,2$ , of the form


<a id="E12"></a>
$$
w_{j}(n)\sim\rho^{n}n^{\alpha_{j}}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{s,j}}{n^{s}}, \tag{2.9.12}
$$

with $a_{0,j}=1$ and higher coefficients given by ( 2.9.7 ) (in the present case the coefficients of $a_{s,j}$ and $a_{s-1,j}$ are zero).

If $\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}=0,1,2,\dots$ , then ( 2.9.12 ) applies only in the case $j=1$ . But there is an independent solution


<a id="E13"></a>
$$
w_{2}(n)\sim\rho^{n}n^{\alpha_{2}}\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}s=0\\
s\neq\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}\end{subarray}}^{\infty}\frac{b_{s}}{n^{s}}+cw_{1}(n)\ln n, \tag{2.9.13}
$$

The coefficients $b_{s}$ and constant $c$ are again determined by formal substitution, beginning with $c=1$ when $\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}=0$ , or with $b_{0}=1$ when $\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}=1,2,3,\dots$ . (Compare ( 2.7.6 ).)

For analogous results for difference equations of the form


<a id="E14"></a>
$$
w(n+2)+n^{P}f(n)w(n+1)+n^{Q}g(n)w(n)=0, \tag{2.9.14}
$$

in which $P$ and $Q$ are any integers see Wong and Li ([1992a](./bib/W.html#bib2444 "Asymptotic expansions for second-order linear difference equations. II")).

Annotations for §2.9 and Ch.2

For asymptotic approximations to solutions of second-order difference equations analogous to the Liouville–Green (WKBJ) approximation for differential equations (§ 2.7(iii) ) see Spigler and Vianello ([1992](./bib/S.html#bib2141 "Liouville-Green approximations for a class of linear oscillatory difference equations of the second order"), [1997](./bib/S.html#bib2142 "A Survey on the Liouville-Green (WKB) Approximation for Linear Difference Equations of the Second Order")) and Spigler et al. ([1999](./bib/S.html#bib2143 "Liouville-Green-Olver approximations for complex difference equations")). Error bounds and applications are included.

For discussions of turning points, transition points, and uniform asymptotic expansions for solutions of linear difference equations of the second order see Wang and Wong ([2003](./bib/W.html#bib2365 "Asymptotic expansions for second-order linear difference equations with a turning point"), [2005](./bib/W.html#bib2366 "Linear difference equations with transition points")).

For an introduction to, and references for, the general asymptotic theory of linear difference equations of arbitrary order, see Wimp ([1984](./bib/W.html#bib2421 "Computation with Recurrence Relations"), Appendix B).

For applications of asymptotic methods for difference equations to orthogonal polynomials, see, e.g. Wang and Wong ([2012](./bib/W.html#bib2857 "Asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials via recurrence relations")) and Wong ([2014](./bib/W.html#bib2858 "Asymptotics of linear recurrences")). These methods are particularly useful when the weight function associated with the orthogonal polynomials is not unique or not even known; see, e.g. Dai et al. ([2014](./bib/D.html#bib2859 "Plancherel-Rotach asymptotic expansion for some polynomials from indeterminate moment problems")).
