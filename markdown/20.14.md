The Fourier series of § 20.2(i) usually converge rapidly because of the factors $q^{(n+\frac{1}{2})^{2}}$ or $q^{n^{2}}$ , and provide a convenient way of calculating values of $\theta_{j}\left(z\middle|\tau\right)$ . Similarly, their $z$ -differentiated forms provide a convenient way of calculating the corresponding derivatives. For instance, the first three terms of ( 20.2.1 ) give the value of $\theta_{1}\left(2-i\middle|i\right)$ ( $=\theta_{1}\left(2-i,e^{-\pi}\right)$ ) to 12 decimal places.

For values of $\left|q\right|$ near $1$ the transformations of § 20.7(viii) can be used to replace $\tau$ with a value that has a larger imaginary part and hence a smaller value of $\left|q\right|$ . For instance, to find $\theta_{3}\left(z,0.9\right)$ we use ( 20.7.32 ) with $q=0.9=e^{i\pi\tau}$ , $\tau=-i\ln\left(0.9\right)/\pi$ . Then $\tau^{\prime}=-1/\tau=-i\pi/\ln\left(0.9\right)$ and $q^{\prime}=e^{i\pi\tau^{\prime}}=\exp\left(\pi^{2}/\ln\left(0.9\right)\right)=(2.07\dots)\times 10^{-41}$ . Hence the first term of the series ( 20.2.3 ) for $\theta_{3}\left(z\tau^{\prime}\middle|\tau^{\prime}\right)$ suffices for most purposes. In theory, starting from any value of $\tau$ , a finite number of applications of the transformations $\tau\to\tau+1$ and $\tau\to-1/\tau$ will result in a value of $\tau$ with $\Im\tau\geq\sqrt{3}/2$ ; see § [23.18](./23.18.md "§23.18 Modular Transformations ‣ Modular Functions ‣ Chapter 23 Weierstrass Elliptic and Modular Functions") . In practice a value with, say, $\Im\tau\geq 1/2$ , $\left|q\right|\leq 0.2$ , is found quickly and is satisfactory for numerical evaluation.
