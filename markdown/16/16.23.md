A variety of problems in classical mechanics and mathematical physics lead to Picard–Fuchs equations. These equations are frequently solvable in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions, and the monodromy of generalized hypergeometric functions plays an important role in describing properties of the solutions. See, for example, Berglund et al. ([1994](./bib/B.html#bib237 "Periods for Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg vacua")).

A substantial transition occurs in a random graph of $n$ vertices when the number of edges becomes approximately $\frac{1}{2}n$ . In Janson et al. ([1993](./bib/J.html#bib1163 "The birth of the giant component")) limiting distributions are discussed for the sparse connected components of these graphs, and the asymptotics of three ${{}_{2}F_{2}}$ functions are applied to compute the expected value of the excess.

The Bieberbach conjecture states that if $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n}$ is a conformal map of the unit disk to any complex domain, then $|a_{n}|\leq n|a_{1}|$ . In the proof of this conjecture de Branges ([1985](./bib/D.html#bib624 "A proof of the Bieberbach conjecture")) uses the inequality


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
{{}_{3}F_{2}}\left({-n,n+\alpha+2,\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+1)\atop\alpha+1,\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+3)};x\right)>0, \tag{16.23.1}
$$

when $0\leq x<1$ , $\alpha>-2$ , and $n=0,1,2,\dots$ . The proof of this inequality is given in Askey and Gasper ([1976](./bib/index.html#bib157 "Positive Jacobi polynomial sums. II")). See also Kazarinoff ([1988](./bib/K.html#bib1238 "Special functions and the Bieberbach conjecture")).

Many combinatorial identities, especially ones involving binomial and related coefficients, are special cases of hypergeometric identities. In Petkovšek et al. ([1996](./bib/P.html#bib1871 "= A B")) tools are given for automated proofs of these identities.
