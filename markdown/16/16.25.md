Annotations for Ch.16
:::

Methods for computing the functions of the present chapter include power series, asymptotic expansions, integral representations, differential equations, and recurrence relations. They are similar to those described for confluent hypergeometric functions, and hypergeometric functions in §§ [13.29](./13.29.md "§13.29 Methods of Computation ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 13 Confluent Hypergeometric Functions") and [15.19](./15.19.md "§15.19 Methods of Computation ‣ Computation ‣ Chapter 15 Hypergeometric Function") . There is, however, an added feature in the numerical solution of differential equations and difference equations (recurrence relations). This occurs when the wanted solution is intermediate in asymptotic growth compared with other solutions. In these cases integration, or recurrence, in either a forward or a backward direction is unstable. Instead a boundary-value problem needs to be formulated and solved. See §§ 3.6(vii) , 3.7(iii) , Olde Daalhuis and Olver ([1998](./bib/O.html#bib1765 "On the asymptotic and numerical solution of linear ordinary differential equations")), Lozier ([1980](./bib/L.html#bib1476 "Numerical Solution of Linear Difference Equations")), and Wimp ([1984](./bib/W.html#bib2421 "Computation with Recurrence Relations"), Chapters 7, 8).
