Generalized hypergeometric functions and Appell functions appear in the evaluation of the so-called Watson integrals which characterize the simplest possible lattice walks. They are also potentially useful for the solution of more complicated restricted lattice walk problems, and the 3D Ising model; see Barber and Ninham ([1970](./bib/B.html#bib190 "Random and Restricted Walks: Theory and Applications"), pp. 147‚Äì148).

Appell functions are used for the evaluation of one-loop integrals in Feynman diagrams. See Cabral-Rosetti and Sanchis-Lozano ([2000](./bib/C.html#bib401 "Generalized hypergeometric functions and the evaluation of scalar one-loop integrals in Feynman diagrams")).

For an extension to two-loop integrals see Moch et al. ([2002](./bib/M.html#bib1643 "Nested sums, expansion of transcendental functions, and multiscale multiloop integrals")).

The $\mathit{3j}$ symbols, or Clebsch‚ÄìGordan coefficients, play an important role in the decomposition of reducible representations of the rotation group into irreducible representations. They can be expressed as ${{}_{3}F_{2}}$ functions with unit argument. The coefficients of transformations between different coupling schemes of three angular momenta are related to the Wigner $\mathit{6j}$ symbols. These are balanced ${{}_{4}F_{3}}$ functions with unit argument. Lastly, special cases of the $\mathit{9j}$ symbols are ${{}_{5}F_{4}}$ functions with unit argument. For further information see Chapter [34](./34.md "Chapter 34 3‚Å¢ùëó,6‚Å¢ùëó,9‚Å¢ùëó Symbols") and Varshalovich et al. ([1988](./bib/V.html#bib2323 "Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum"), ¬ß¬ß8.2.5, 8.8, and 9.2.3).
