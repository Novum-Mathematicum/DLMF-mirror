**Clarification (effective with 1.0.17):**

The references Wu et al. ([1976](./bib/W.html#bib2898 "Spin-spin correlation functions for the two-dimensional Ising model: Exact theory in the scaling region")) and McCoy et al. ([1977](./bib/M.html#bib1578 "Painlevé functions of the third kind")) were inserted in Paragraph Other Applications for the Ising model. Incidentally, the editors have also corrected the title: to *Physical Applications* from *Physical* . *Suggested by Craig Tracy*

Statistical physics, especially classical and quantum spin models, has proved to be a major area for research problems in the modern theory of Painlevé transcendents. For a survey see McCoy ([1992](./bib/M.html#bib2689 "Spin Systems, Statistical Mechanics and Painlevé Functions")). See also McCoy et al. ([1977](./bib/M.html#bib1578 "Painlevé functions of the third kind")), Jimbo et al. ([1980](./bib/J.html#bib2690 "Density matrix of an impenetrable Bose gas and the fifth Painlevé transcendent")), Essler et al. ([1996](./bib/E.html#bib2691 "Painlevé transcendent describes quantum correlation function of the ⁢ X X Z antiferromagnet away from the free-fermion point")), and Kanzieper ([2002](./bib/K.html#bib2628 "Replica field theories, Painlevé transcendents, and exact correlation functions")).
