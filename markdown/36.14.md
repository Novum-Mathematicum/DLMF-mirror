The physical manifestations of bifurcation sets are caustics. These are the structurally stable focal singularities (envelopes) of families of rays, on which the intensities of the geometrical (ray) theory diverge. Diffraction catastrophes describe the (linear) wave amplitudes that smooth the geometrical caustic singularities and decorate them with interference patterns. See Berry ([1969](./bib/B.html#bib249 "Uniform approximation: A new concept in wave theory"), [1976](./bib/B.html#bib251 "Waves and Thom’s theorem"), [1980](./bib/B.html#bib253 "Some Geometric Aspects of Wave Motion: Wavefront Dislocations, Diffraction Catastrophes, Diffractals"), [1981](./bib/B.html#bib254 "Singularities in Waves and Rays")), Kravtsov ([1964](./bib/K.html#bib1344 "Asymptotic solution of Maxwell’s equations near caustics"), [1988](./bib/K.html#bib1346 "Rays and caustics as physical objects")), and Ludwig ([1966](./bib/L.html#bib1484 "Uniform asymptotic expansions at a caustic")).

Diffraction catastrophes describe the connection between ray optics and wave optics. Applications include twinkling starlight, focusing of sunlight by rippling water (e.g., swimming-pool patterns), and water-droplet “lenses” (e.g., rainbows). See Adler et al. ([1997](./bib/index.html#bib35 "High-order interior caustics produced in scattering of a diagonally incident plane wave by a circular cylinder")), Berry and Upstill ([1980](./bib/B.html#bib267 "Catastrophe optics: Morphologies of caustics and their diffraction patterns")), Marston ([1992](./bib/M.html#bib1555 "Geometrical and Catastrophe Optics Methods in Scattering"), [1999](./bib/M.html#bib1556 "Catastrophe optics of spheroidal drops and generalized rainbows")), Nye ([1999](./bib/N.html#bib1739 "Natural Focusing and Fine Structure of Light: Caustics and Wave Dislocations")), Walker ([1983](./bib/W.html#bib2355 "Caustics: Mathematical curves generated by light shined through rippled plastic"), [1988](./bib/W.html#bib2356 "Shadows cast on the bottom of a pool are not like other shadows. Why?"), [1989](./bib/W.html#bib2357 "A drop of water becomes a gateway into the world of catastrophe optics")).

Diffraction catastrophes describe the “semiclassical” connections between classical orbits and quantum wavefunctions, for integrable (non-chaotic) systems. Applications include scattering of elementary particles, atoms and molecules from particles and surfaces, and chemical reactions. See Berry ([1966](./bib/B.html#bib248 "Uniform approximation for potential scattering involving a rainbow"), [1975](./bib/B.html#bib250 "Cusped rainbows and incoherence effects in the rippling-mirror model for particle scattering from surfaces")), Connor ([1974](./bib/C.html#bib567 "Semiclassical theory of molecular collisions: Many nearly coincident classical trajectories"), [1976](./bib/C.html#bib568 "Catastrophes and molecular collisions")), Connor and Farrelly ([1981](./bib/C.html#bib572 "Molecular collisions and cusp catastrophes: Three methods for the calculation of Pearcey’s integral and its derivatives")), Trinkaus and Drepper ([1977](./bib/T.html#bib2280 "On the analysis of diffraction catastrophes")), and Uzer et al.

Applications include the reflection of ultrasound pulses, and acoustical waveguides.
