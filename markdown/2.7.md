An *ordinary point* of the differential equation

$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}w}{{\mathrm{d}z}^{2}}+f(z)\frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}z}+g(z)w=0 \tag{2.7.1}
$$

is one at which the coefficients $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic. All solutions are analytic at an ordinary point, and their Taylor-series expansions are found by equating coefficients.

Other points $z_{0}$ are *singularities* of the differential equation. If both $(z-z_{0})f(z)$ and $(z-z_{0})^{2}g(z)$ are analytic at $z_{0}$ , then $z_{0}$ is a *regular singularity* (or *singularity of the first kind* ). All other singularities are classified as *irregular* .

In a punctured neighborhood $\mathbf{N}$ of a regular singularity $z_{0}$

with at least one of the coefficients $f_{0}$ , $g_{0}$ , $g_{1}$ nonzero. Let $\alpha_{1}$ , $\alpha_{2}$ denote the *indices* or *exponents* , that is, the roots of the *indicial equation*


<a id="E3"></a>
$$
Q(\alpha)\equiv\alpha(\alpha-1)+f_{0}\alpha+g_{0}=0. \tag{2.7.3}
$$

Provided that $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}$ is not zero or an integer, equation ( 2.7.1 ) has independent solutions $w_{j}(z)$ , $j=1,2$ , such that


<a id="E4"></a>
$$
w_{j}(z)=(z-z_{0})^{\alpha_{j}}\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}a_{s,j}(z-z_{0})^{s}, \tag{2.7.4}
$$

with $a_{0,j}=1$ , and


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
Q(\alpha_{j}+s)a_{s,j}=-\sum_{r=0}^{s-1}\left((\alpha_{j}+r)f_{s-r}+g_{s-r}\right)a_{r,j}, \tag{2.7.5}
$$

when $s=1,2,3,\dots$ .

If $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}=0,1,2,\dots$ , then ( 2.7.4 ) applies only in the case $j=1$ . But there is an independent solution


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
w_{2}(z)=(z-z_{0})^{\alpha_{2}}\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}s=0\\
s\neq\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}\end{subarray}}^{\infty}b_{s}(z-z_{0})^{s}+cw_{1}(z)\ln\left(z-z_{0}\right), \tag{2.7.6}
$$

The coefficients $b_{s}$ and constant $c$ are again determined by equating coefficients in the differential equation, beginning with $c=1$ when $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}=0$ , or with $b_{0}=1$ when $\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}=1,2,3,\dots$ .

The radii of convergence of the series ( 2.7.4 ), ( 2.7.6 ) are not less than the distance of the next nearest singularity of the differential equation from $z_{0}$ .

To include the point at infinity in the foregoing classification scheme, we transform it into the origin by replacing $z$ in ( 2.7.1 ) with $1/z$ ; see Olver ([1997b](./bib/O.html#bib1809 "Asymptotics and Special Functions"), pp. 153–154). For corresponding definitions, together with examples, for linear differential equations of arbitrary order see §§ 16.8(i) – 16.8(ii) .

If the singularities of $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ at $z_{0}$ are no worse than poles, then $z_{0}$ has *rank* $\ell-1$ , where $\ell$ is the least integer such that $(z-z_{0})^{\ell}f(z)$ and $(z-z_{0})^{2\ell}g(z)$ are analytic at $z_{0}$ . Thus a regular singularity has rank 0. The most common type of irregular singularity for special functions has rank 1 and is located at infinity. Then

$$

provided that $\mathcal{V}_{a_{j},x}\left(F\right)<\infty$ . Here $F(x)$ is the *error-control function*


<a id="E24"></a>
$$
F(x)=\int\left(\frac{1}{f^{1/4}}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}}{{\mathrm{d}x}^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{f^{1/4}}\right)-\frac{g}{f^{1/2}}\right)\,\mathrm{d}x, \tag{2.7.24}

and $\mathcal{V}$ denotes the variational operator (§ 2.3(i) ). Thus


<a id="E25"></a>
$$
\mathcal{V}_{a_{j},x}\left(F\right)=\left|\int_{a_{j}}^{x}\left|\frac{1}{f^{1/4}(t)}\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}}{{\mathrm{d}t}^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{f^{1/4}(t)}\right)-\frac{g(t)}{f^{1/2}(t)}\right|\,\mathrm{d}t\right|. \tag{2.7.25}

Assuming also $\mathcal{V}_{a_{1},a_{2}}\left(F\right)<\infty$ , we have

$$
w_{2}(x)\sim f^{-1/4}(x)\exp\left(-\int f^{1/2}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right), \tag{2.7.27}
$$

Suppose in addition $|\int f^{1/2}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x|$ is unbounded as $x\to a_{1}+$ and $x\to a_{2}-$ . Then there are solutions $w_{3}(x)$ , $w_{4}(x)$ , such that


<a id="E28"></a>
$$
w_{3}(x)\sim f^{-1/4}(x)\exp\left(\int f^{1/2}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right), \tag{2.7.28}

$$
w_{4}(x)\sim f^{-1/4}(x)\exp\left(-\int f^{1/2}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right), \tag{2.7.29}
$$

The solutions with the properties ( 2.7.26 ), ( 2.7.27 ) are unique, but not those with the properties ( 2.7.28 ), ( 2.7.29 ). In fact, since


<a id="E30"></a>
$$
w_{1}(x)/w_{4}(x)\to 0, \tag{2.7.30}
$$

$w_{1}(x)$ is a *recessive* (or *subdominant* ) solution as $x\to a_{1}+$ , and $w_{4}(x)$ is a *dominant* solution as $x\to a_{1}+$ . Similarly for $w_{2}(x)$ and $w_{3}(x)$ as $x\to a_{2}-$ .

For other examples, and also the corresponding results when $f(x)$ is negative, see Olver ([1997b](./bib/O.html#bib1809 "Asymptotics and Special Functions"), Chapter 6), Olver ([1980a](./bib/O.html#bib1801 "Asymptotic approximations and error bounds")), Taylor ([1978](./bib/T.html#bib2206 "Error bounds for the Liouville-Green approximation to initial-value problems"), [1982](./bib/T.html#bib2207 "Improved error bounds for the Liouville-Green (or WKB) approximation")), and Smith ([1986](./bib/S.html#bib2124 "Liouville-Green approximations via the Riccati transformation")). The first of these references includes extensions to complex variables and reversions for zeros.

Annotations for §2.7 and Ch.2

One pair of independent solutions of the equation


<a id="E35"></a>
$$
\ifrac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}w}{{\mathrm{d}z}^{2}}=w \tag{2.7.35}
$$

is $w_{1}(z)=e^{z}$ , $w_{2}(z)=e^{-z}$ . Another is $w_{3}(z)=\cosh z$ , $w_{4}(z)=\sinh z$ . In theory either pair may be used to construct any other solution


<a id="E36"></a>
$$
w(z)=Aw_{1}(z)+Bw_{2}(z), \tag{2.7.36}
$$

or


<a id="E37"></a>
$$
w(z)=Cw_{3}(z)+Dw_{4}(z), \tag{2.7.37}
$$

where $A,B,C,D$ are constants. From the numerical standpoint, however, the pair $w_{3}(z)$ and $w_{4}(z)$ has the drawback that severe numerical cancellation can occur with certain combinations of $C$ and $D$ , for example if $C$ and $D$ are equal, or nearly equal, and $z$ , or $\Re z$ , is large and negative. This kind of cancellation cannot take place with $w_{1}(z)$ and $w_{2}(z)$ , and for this reason, and following Miller ([1950](./bib/M.html#bib1620 "On the choice of standard solutions for a homogeneous linear differential equation of the second order")), we call $w_{1}(z)$ and $w_{2}(z)$ a *numerically satisfactory pair* of solutions.

The solutions $w_{1}(z)$ and $w_{2}(z)$ are respectively recessive and dominant as $\Re z\to-\infty$ , and *vice versa* as $\Re z\to+\infty$ . This is characteristic of numerically satisfactory pairs. In a neighborhood, or sectorial neighborhood of a singularity, one member has to be recessive. In consequence, if a differential equation has more than one singularity in the extended plane, then usually more than two standard solutions need to be chosen in order to have numerically satisfactory representations everywhere.

In oscillatory intervals, and again following Miller ([1950](./bib/M.html#bib1620 "On the choice of standard solutions for a homogeneous linear differential equation of the second order")), we call a pair of solutions numerically satisfactory if asymptotically they have the same amplitude and are $\tfrac{1}{2}\pi$ out of phase.
