| $x$ , $y$ | real variables. |
|---|---|
| $z$ , $\zeta$ , $w$ , $W$ | complex variables. |
| $j$ , $k$ , $\ell$ , $m$ , $n$ | nonnegative integers. |
| $a$ | complex parameter, $\|a\|\geq 1,a\neq 1$ . |
| $q,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\epsilon,\nu$ | complex parameters. |


The main functions treated in this chapter are $\mathit{H\!\ell}\left(a,q;\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z\right)$ , $(s_{1},s_{2})\mathit{Hf}_{m}\left(a,q_{m};\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z\right)$ , $(s_{1},s_{2})\mathit{Hf}_{m}^{\nu}\left(a,q_{m};\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z\right)$ , and the polynomial $\mathit{Hp}_{n,m}\left(a,q_{n,m};-n,\beta,\gamma,\delta;z\right)$ . These notations were introduced by Arscott in Ronveaux ([1995](./bib/R.html#bib1965 "Heun’s Differential Equations"), pp. 34–44). Sometimes the parameters are suppressed.
