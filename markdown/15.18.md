Annotations for Ch.15
:::

The hypergeometric function has allowed the development of “solvable” models for one-dimensional quantum scattering through and over barriers (Eckart ([1930](./bib/E.html#bib2674 "The penetration of a potential barrier by electrons")), Bhattacharjie and Sudarshan ([1962](./bib/B.html#bib2669 "A class of solvable potentials"))), and generalized to include position-dependent effective masses (Dekar et al. ([1999](./bib/D.html#bib2676 "Wave function for smooth potential and mass step"))).

More varied applications include photon scattering from atoms (Gavrila ([1967](./bib/G.html#bib2675 "Elastic scattering of photons by a hydrogen atom"))), energy distributions of particles in plasmas (Mace and Hellberg ([1995](./bib/M.html#bib2671 "A dispersion function for plasmas containing superthermal particles"))), conformal field theory of critical phenomena (Burkhardt and Xue ([1991](./bib/B.html#bib2673 "Density profiles in confined critical systems and conformal invariance"))), quantum chromo-dynamics (Atkinson and Johnson ([1988](./bib/index.html#bib2670 "Chiral-symmetry breaking in QCD. I. The infrared domain"))), and general parametrization of the effective potentials of interaction between atoms in diatomic molecules (Herrick and O’Connor ([1998](./bib/H.html#bib2672 "Inverse virial symmetry of diatomic potential curves"))).
