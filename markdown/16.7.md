:::

For orthogonal polynomials see Chapter [18](./18.md "Chapter 18 Orthogonal Polynomials") . For $\mathit{3j}$ , $\mathit{6j}$ , $\mathit{9j}$ symbols see Chapter [34](./34.md "Chapter 34 3⁢𝑗,6⁢𝑗,9⁢𝑗 Symbols") . Further representations of special functions in terms of ${{}_{p}F_{q}}$ functions are given in Luke ([1969a](./bib/L.html#bib1495 "The Special Functions and their Approximations, Vol. 1"), §§6.2–6.3), and an extensive list of ${{}_{q+1}F_{q}}$ functions with rational numbers as parameters is given in Krupnikov and Kölbig ([1997](./bib/K.html#bib1352 "Some special cases of the generalized hypergeometric function F q + q 1")).
