Annotations for Ch.28
:::

Addition theorems provide important connections between Mathieu functions with different parameters and in different coordinate systems. They are analogous to the addition theorems for Bessel functions (ยง 10.23(ii) ) and modified Bessel functions (ยง 10.44(ii) ). For a comprehensive treatment see Meixner et al. ([1980](./bib/M.html#bib1599 "Mathieu Functions and Spheroidal Functions and Their Mathematical Foundations: Further Studies"), ยง2.2).
