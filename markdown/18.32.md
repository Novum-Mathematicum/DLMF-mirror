**Addition (effective with 1.2.0):**

The sentence containing ( 18.32.1 ) was significanltly modified and now covers more details. Equation ( 18.32.2 ) and two paragraphs surrounding it were added with more details.

**Amendment (effective with 1.0.1):**

References were added at the end of this section for more general Freud weights.

Annotations for Ch.18
:::

A *Freud weight* is a weight function of the form


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
{w(x)=\exp\left(-Q(x)\right)}, \tag{18.32.1}
$$

where $Q(x)$ is real, even, nonnegative, and continuously differentiable, where $xQ^{\prime}(x)$ increases for $x>0$ , and $Q^{\prime}(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to\infty$ , see Freud ([1969](./bib/F.html#bib3011 "On weighted polynomial approximation on the whole real axis")). These conditions on $Q(x)$ have been strengthened and also relaxed in literature. See the early survey by Nevai ([1986](./bib/N.html#bib1712 "Géza Freud, orthogonal polynomials and Christoffel functions. A case study"), Part 2). Of special interest are the cases $Q(x)=x^{2m}$ , $m=1,2,\dots$ , and the case $Q(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-tx^{2}$ ( $t\in\mathbb{R}$ ), see § [32.15](./32.15.md "§32.15 Orthogonal Polynomials ‣ Applications ‣ Chapter 32 Painlevé Transcendents") . No explicit expressions for the corresponding OP’s are available. However, for asymptotic approximations in terms of elementary functions for the OP’s, and also for their largest zeros, see Levin and Lubinsky ([2001](./bib/L.html#bib1424 "Orthogonal Polynomials for Exponential Weights")) and Nevai ([1986](./bib/N.html#bib1712 "Géza Freud, orthogonal polynomials and Christoffel functions. A case study")). For a uniform asymptotic expansion in terms of Airy functions (§ [9.2](./9.2.md "§9.2 Differential Equation ‣ Airy Functions ‣ Chapter 9 Airy and Related Functions") ) for the OP’s in the case $Q(x)=x^{4}$ see Bo and Wong ([1999](./bib/B.html#bib306 "A uniform asymptotic formula for orthogonal polynomials associated with exp ( - x 4 )")).

For asymptotic approximations to OP’s that correspond to Freud weights with more general functions $Q(x)$ see Deift et al. ([1999a](./bib/D.html#bib2739 "Strong asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential weights"), [b](./bib/D.html#bib2738 "Uniform asymptotics for polynomials orthogonal with respect to varying exponential weights and applications to universality questions in random matrix theory")), Bleher and Its ([1999](./bib/B.html#bib2740 "Semiclassical asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials, Riemann-Hilbert problem, and universality in the matrix model")), and Kriecherbauer and McLaughlin ([1999](./bib/K.html#bib2741 "Strong asymptotics of polynomials orthogonal with respect to Freud weights")).

*Generalized Freud weights* have the form


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
w(x)={\left|x\right|}^{\alpha}\exp\left(-Q(x)\right), \tag{18.32.2}
$$

with $Q(x)$ satisfying similar conditions as before, see Kasuga and Sakai ([2003](./bib/K.html#bib3034 "Orthonormal polynomials with generalized Freud-type weights")). The case $Q(x)={\left|x\right|}^{\beta}$ ( $\beta>0$ ) was already introduced by Freud ([1976](./bib/F.html#bib2687 "On the coefficients in the recursion formulae of orthogonal polynomials")). The special case $Q(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-tx^{2}$ is of particular interest, see Clarkson and Jordaan ([2018](./bib/C.html#bib3002 "Properties of generalized Freud polynomials")).

All of these forms appear in applications, see § 18.39(iii) and Table 18.39.1 , albeit sometimes with $x\in[0,\infty)$ , where the term *half-Freud weight* is used; or on $x\in[-1,1]$ or $[0,1]$ , where the term *Rys weight* is employed, see Rys et al. ([1983](./bib/R.html#bib3074 "Computation of electron repulsion integrals using the Rys quadrature method")). For (generalized) Freud weights on a subinterval of $[0,\infty)$ see also Levin and Lubinsky ([2005](./bib/L.html#bib3044 "Orthogonal polynomials for exponential weights ⁢ x ⁢ 2 ρ e - ⁢ 2 Q ( x ) on [ 0 , d )")).
