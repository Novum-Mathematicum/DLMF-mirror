Table 18.2 in Abramowitz and Stegun ([1964](./bib/index.html#bib24 "Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables")) gives values of $\wp\left(z\right)$ , $\wp'\left(z\right)$ , and $\zeta\left(z\right)$ to 7 or 8D in the rectangular and rhombic cases, normalized so that $\omega_{1}=1$ and $\omega_{3}=ia$ (rectangular case), or $\omega_{1}=1$ and $\omega_{3}=\tfrac{1}{2}+ia$ (rhombic case), for $a$ = 1.00, 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2, 4. The values are tabulated on the real and imaginary $z$ -axes, mostly ranging from 0 to 1 or $i$ in steps of length 0.05, and in the case of $\wp\left(z\right)$ the user may deduce values for complex $z$ by application of the addition theorem ( 23.10.1 ).

Abramowitz and Stegun ([1964](./bib/index.html#bib24 "Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables")) also includes other tables to assist the computation of the Weierstrass functions, for example, the generators as functions of the lattice invariants $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ .

For earlier tables related to Weierstrass functions see Fletcher et al. ([1962](./bib/F.html#bib810 "An Index of Mathematical Tables. Vols. I, II"), pp. 503–505) and Lebedev and Fedorova ([1960](./bib/L.html#bib1392 "A Guide to Mathematical Tables"), pp. 223–226).
