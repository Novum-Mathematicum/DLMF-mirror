The boundary of the rectangle $R$ , with vertices $0$ , $\omega_{1}$ , $\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}$ , $\omega_{3}$ , is mapped strictly monotonically by $\wp$ onto the real line with $0\to\infty$ , $\omega_{1}\to e_{1}$ , $\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}\to e_{2}$ , $\omega_{3}\to e_{3}$ , $0\to-\infty$ . There is a unique point $z_{0}\in[\omega_{1},\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}]\cup[\omega_{1}+\omega_{3},\omega_{3}]$ such that $\wp\left(z_{0}\right)=0$ . The interior of $R$ is mapped one-to-one onto the lower half-plane.

The two pairs of edges $[0,\omega_{1}]\cup[\omega_{1},2\omega_{3}]$ and $[2\omega_{3},2\omega_{3}-\omega_{1}]\cup[2\omega_{3}-\omega_{1},0]$ of $R$ are each mapped strictly monotonically by $\wp$ onto the real line, with $0\to\infty$ , $\omega_{1}\to e_{1}$ , $2\omega_{3}\to-\infty$ ; similarly for the other pair of edges. For each pair of edges there is a unique point $z_{0}$ such that $\wp\left(z_{0}\right)=0$ .

The interior of the rectangle with vertices $0$ , $\omega_{1}$ , $2\omega_{3}$ , $2\omega_{3}-\omega_{1}$ is mapped two-to-one onto the lower half-plane. The interior of the rectangle with vertices $0$ , $\omega_{1}$ , $\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}$ , $\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}-\omega_{3}$ is mapped one-to-one onto the lower half-plane with a cut from $e_{3}$ to $\wp\left(\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}\right)\>(=\wp\left(\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}-\omega_{3}\right))$ . The cut is the image of the edge from $\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}+\omega_{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}\omega_{1}-\omega_{3}$ and is not a line segment.

An algebraic curve that can be put either into the form


<a id="E1"></a>
$$
C:y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b, \tag{23.20.1}
$$

or equivalently, on replacing $x$ by $x/z$ and $y$ by $y/z$ (projective coordinates), into the form


<a id="E2"></a>
$$
C:y^{2}z=x^{3}+axz^{2}+bz^{3}, \tag{23.20.2}
$$

is an example of an *elliptic curve* (§ 22.18(iv) ). Here $a$ and $b$ are real or complex constants.

Points $P=(x,y)$ on the curve can be parametrized by $x=\wp\left(z;g_{2},g_{3}\right)$ , $2y=\wp'\left(z;g_{2},g_{3}\right)$ , where $g_{2}=-4a$ and $g_{3}=-4b$ : in this case we write $P=P(z)$ . The curve $C$ is made into an abelian group (Macdonald ([1968](./bib/M.html#bib1514 "The Theory of Groups"), Chapter 5)) by defining the zero element $o=(0,1,0)$ as the point at infinity, the negative of $P=(x,y)$ by $-P=(x,-y)$ , and generally $P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3}=0$ on the curve iff the points $P_{1}$ , $P_{2}$ , $P_{3}$ are collinear. It follows from the addition formula ( 23.10.1 ) that the points $P_{j}=P(z_{j})$ , $j=1,2,3$ , have zero sum iff $z_{1}+z_{2}+z_{3}\in\mathbb{L}$ , so that addition of points on the curve $C$ corresponds to addition of parameters $z_{j}$ on the torus $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{L}$ ; see McKean and Moll ([1999](./bib/M.html#bib1582 "Elliptic Curves"), §§2.11, 2.14).

In terms of $(x,y)$ the addition law can be expressed $(x,y)+o=(x,y)$ , $(x,y)+(x,-y)=o$ ; otherwise $(x_{1},y_{1})+(x_{2},y_{2})=(x_{3},y_{3})$ , where

<a id="E3"></a>

<a id="Ex1"></a>
$$
\displaystyle x_{3} \displaystyle=m^{2}-x_{1}-x_{2}, \tag{23.20.3}
$$

<a id="Ex2"></a>
$$
\displaystyle y_{3} \displaystyle=-m(x_{3}-x_{1})-y_{1},
$$

If $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ , then $C$ intersects the plane ${\mathbb{R}}^{2}$ in a curve that is connected if $\Delta\equiv 4a^{3}+27b^{2}>0$ ; if $\Delta<0$ , then the intersection has two components, one of which is a closed loop. These cases correspond to rhombic and rectangular lattices, respectively. The addition law states that to find the sum of two points, take the third intersection with $C$ of the chord joining them (or the tangent if they coincide); then its reflection in the $x$ -axis gives the required sum. The geometric nature of this construction is illustrated in McKean and Moll ([1999](./bib/M.html#bib1582 "Elliptic Curves"), §2.14), Koblitz ([1993](./bib/K.html#bib1299 "Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms"), §§6, 7), and Silverman and Tate ([1992](./bib/S.html#bib2086 "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves"), Chapter 1, §§3, 4): each of these references makes a connection with the addition theorem ( 23.10.1 ).

If $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$ , then by rescaling we may assume $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Let $T$ denote the set of points on $C$ that are of finite order (that is, those points $P$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ with $nP=o$ ), and let $I,K$ be the sets of points with integer and rational coordinates, respectively. Then $\emptyset\subseteq T\subseteq I\subseteq K\subseteq C$ . Both $T,K$ are subgroups of $C$ , though $I$ may not be. $K$ always has the form $T\times{\mathbb{Z}}^{r}$ ( *Mordell’s Theorem* : Silverman and Tate ([1992](./bib/S.html#bib2086 "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves"), Chapter 3, §5)); the determination of $r$ , the rank of $K$ , raises questions of great difficulty, many of which are still open. Both $T$ and $I$ are finite sets. $T$ must have one of the forms $\mathbb{Z}/(n\mathbb{Z})$ , $1\leq n\leq 10$ or $n=12$ , or $(\mathbb{Z}/(2\mathbb{Z}))\times(\mathbb{Z}/(2n\mathbb{Z}))$ , $1\leq n\leq 4$ . To determine $T$ , we make use of the fact that if $(x,y)\in T$ then $y^{2}$ must be a divisor of $\Delta$ ; hence there are only a finite number of possibilities for $y$ . Values of $x$ are then found as integer solutions of $x^{3}+ax+b-y^{2}=0$ (in particular $x$ must be a divisor of $b-y^{2}$ ). The resulting points are then tested for finite order as follows. Given $P$ , calculate $2P$ , $4P$ , $8P$ by doubling as above. If any of these quantities is zero, then the point has finite order. If any of $2P$ , $4P$ , $8P$ is not an integer, then the point has infinite order. Otherwise observe any equalities between $P$ , $2P$ , $4P$ , $8P$ , and their negatives. The order of a point (if finite and not already determined) can have only the values 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, or 12, and so can be found from $2P=-P$ , $4P=-P$ , $4P=-2P$ , $8P=P$ , $8P=-P$ , $8P=-2P$ , or $8P=-4P$ . If none of these equalities hold, then $P$ has infinite order.

The *modular equation* of degree $p$ , $p$ prime, is an algebraic equation in $\alpha=\lambda\left(p\tau\right)$ and $\beta=\lambda\left(\tau\right)$ . For $p=2,3,5,7$ and with $u=\alpha^{1/4}$ , $v=\beta^{1/4}$ , the modular equation is as follows:


<a id="E5"></a>
$$
v^{8}(1+u^{8})=4u^{4}, \tag{23.20.5}
$$


<a id="E6"></a>
$$
u^{4}-v^{4}+2uv(1-u^{2}v^{2})=0, \tag{23.20.6}
$$


<a id="E7"></a>
$$
{u^{6}-v^{6}+5u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2}-v^{2})+4uv(1-u^{4}v^{4})=0}, \tag{23.20.7}
$$


<a id="E8"></a>
$$
(1-u^{8})(1-v^{8})=(1-uv)^{8}, \tag{23.20.8}
$$
