              In eq. (4.2) $\phi(\zeta)$ should be replaced by $\psi(\zeta)$.
              In the second line of eq. (4.7) insert an external factor
              $e^{-2\pi ij/3}$ and change the upper limit of the sum
              to $n-1$.
              In eq. (4.15) the factor $\zeta$ is missing from the arguments
              of the functions Bi$_\nu$ and Bi'$_\nu$.},
