     enote = {SPHEREPACK 2.0 is a collection of Fortran programs that facilitates
              computer modeling of geophysical processes. Accurate solutions are
              obtained via the spectral method that uses both scalar and vector
              spherical harmonic transforms. The package also contains utility programs
              for computing the associated Legendre functions. SPHEREPACK 3.1 was
              released in August 2003.},
