      note = {This system provides a uniform interface in C++, named e\_float,
              to perform arithmetic operations and to calculate  mathematical functions
              that are implemented in several different MP packages.  It is a free, open-source,
              multiple precision package that allows the computation of many special functions.
              It supports calculations with 30â€¦.300 decimal digits and is
              interoperable with Microsoft's CLR, Python and Mathematica.},
