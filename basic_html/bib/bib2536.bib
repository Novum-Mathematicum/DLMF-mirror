      note = {MPFR is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations
              with correct rounding. The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library
              for multiple-precision floating-point computation which is both
              efficient and has well-defined semantics. MPFR includes most of the
              elementary functions. It also implements the gamma function, and more
              special functions are planned in the future.},
